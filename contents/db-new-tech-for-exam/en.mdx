## Why Does the Engineer Exam Favor 'Data Warehouse'?

With so many new big data technologies, why does 'Data Warehouse' consistently appear on the exam? It's because the data warehouse is the **starting point for all activities that turn data into business value**.

- **'Cleansing' and 'Integration' of Data**: It's the first step in gathering scattered operational data and organizing it cleanly by subject.
- **Foundation for Analysis**: Only with this refined data can higher-level analyses like data mining, BI reporting, and AI model training become possible.

In conclusion, the examiners want to assess whether you understand the **entire data utilization process and its underlying principles**, not just whether you know the latest technologies. The data warehouse embodies these core principles.

## üí° 3 Fundamental Principles Driving Data Technology

Just as the data warehouse is the 'root' of data utilization, there are core principles driving the current data technology paradigm. Understanding these principles makes it easy to grasp numerous new technologies.

> ‚≠êÔ∏è : Frequently tested core concepts

| Technology | Core Principle | What It Enables |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **‚≠êÔ∏èHadoop & Distributed Tech** | **Distribution**: Storing and processing large data across multiple machines. | Almost all big data tech, cloud storage, large-scale AI model training. |
| **‚≠êÔ∏èData Warehouse & Mining** | **Integration & Extraction**: Gathering and refining data to discover knowledge. | Business Intelligence (BI), CRM, Recommendation Systems. |
| **MyData & Scrapy** | **Sovereignty & Automation**: Individuals control data, machines automate collection. | Personalized financial/medical services, data-driven business models. |

### 1. ‚≠êÔ∏èHadoop and Distributed Technology (Distribution)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="Overcoming limitations and processing massive data through 'distribution'.">
  - **Concept**: Instead of one supercomputer, it links many commodity computers to act as one giant system. Data is split and stored across these machines (**HDFS**), and computational tasks are also divided and processed simultaneously (**MapReduce**).
  - **Why It's Fundamental**: Without this 'distribution' paradigm, today's big data, AI, and cloud technologies would not exist. It's the foundation for all tasks involving petabyte-scale data processing and training AI models with billions of parameters.
</Details>

### 2. ‚≠êÔ∏èData Warehouse and Data Mining (Integration & Extraction)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="Finding hidden value in data through 'integration' and 'extraction'.">
  - **Concept**:
    - **Data Warehouse**: A repository that **'integrates'** data from various sources (ERP, CRM, logs) and **'cleanses'** it into a format suitable for analysis.
    - **Data Mining**: The technology to **'extract'** meaningful patterns, rules, and **'knowledge'** from this well-refined data.
  - **Why It's Fundamental**: It goes beyond simply storing data, enabling an organization to make data-driven **decisions**. It forms the basis of all Business Intelligence (BI), CRM, and recommendation systems.
</Details>

### 3. MyData and Scrapy (Sovereignty & Automation)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="Returning data 'sovereignty' to individuals and 'automating' collection.">
  - **Concept**:
    - **MyData**: A concept that returns the control of personal data, or **'data sovereignty'**, from companies and institutions to the individual. Individuals can move their data where they want (portability) and use it themselves.
    - **Scrapy**: A technology where programs, not humans, **'automatically'** collect and structure vast amounts of public data from the web.
  - **Why It's Fundamental**: It presents a new paradigm for data ownership and utilization. Individuals become the owners of their data, and businesses create new models through automated collection.
