## üß† Understanding Pages and Page Faults

For a computer to execute a program, its code and data must be loaded into **physical memory (RAM)**. However, RAM is limited, and running multiple programs simultaneously can lead to a shortage of space. This is where the operating system uses a technique called **virtual memory**.

### 1. What is a Page?

A **page** is a **fixed-size block** of memory used to manage memory in a virtual memory system. It's a way of dividing a program's code and data, stored on a secondary storage device like a hard disk, into equal-sized chunks. RAM is also divided into **frames** of the same size as pages.

- **Key Idea**: A process is divided into pages, and these pages must be loaded into RAM frames to be executed.

### 2. What is a Page Fault?

A **page fault** occurs when a process tries to access a page that is not currently in RAM (physical memory).

When a page fault happens, the following steps occur:

1.  The CPU transfers control to the operating system (OS).
2.  The OS finds the required page on the secondary storage device.
3.  If there is a free frame in RAM, the page is loaded into it.
4.  **What if there are no free frames?** An existing page in RAM is moved out to the secondary storage (swap-out), and the new page is brought into the now-free frame (swap-in).

The rule that decides "which page to swap out" is the **page replacement algorithm**.

## üîÑ Major Page Replacement Algorithms

The goal of a page replacement algorithm is to **minimize the number of page faults**, thereby improving system performance. FIFO, LRU, and LFU are the most well-known algorithms.

### 1. FIFO (First-In, First-Out)

This is the simplest algorithm. It evicts the **page that has been in RAM the longest**, just like a queue where the first person to arrive is the first to leave.

-   **Advantage**: Very simple to implement.
-   **Disadvantage**: It can be inefficient by replacing a frequently used page simply because it was loaded first. This is known as **Belady's Anomaly**, where increasing the number of frames can paradoxically increase the number of page faults.

### 2. LRU (Least Recently Used)

This algorithm replaces the **page that has not been used for the longest period of time**. It is based on the idea of **temporal locality**, which suggests that pages used recently are likely to be used again in the near future.

-   **Advantage**: Generally results in a lower page fault rate than FIFO and performs well.

-   **Disadvantage**: Requires tracking the last access time for each page, which adds overhead and complexity to the OS.

### 3. LFU (Least Frequently Used)

This algorithm replaces the **page with the lowest reference count**. It operates on the assumption that pages used frequently in the past will be used frequently in the future.

-   **Advantage**: It can account for long-term access patterns that LRU might miss.

-   **Disadvantages**:
    -   The overhead of calculating reference counts is significant.
    -   A page that was heavily used initially but is no longer needed might remain in memory.
    -   If multiple pages have the same reference count, an additional rule (e.g., FIFO) is needed to decide which one to replace.
