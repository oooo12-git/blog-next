> üí° **Interface communication technologies** define how clients and servers interact, and questions comparing the purpose and features of each technology frequently appear on the Information Processing Engineer exam.

## üîÑ Interface Communication Technologies

These are various technologies used for data exchange between a client and a server. Each technology has a different purpose and characteristics.

### 1. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)

**AJAX** is a **development technique** that allows web pages to update dynamically by exchanging data with a server asynchronously in the background, without reloading the entire page.

- **Core Role**: Uses the `XMLHttpRequest` object to send requests to the server and receive responses.
- **Features**:
  - Enhances user experience (UX) by updating only the necessary parts of the page without a full reload.
  - Although XML is in its name, it now primarily uses the lightweight **JSON** format for data exchange.
  - AJAX is more of a **paradigm** that uses several technologies (JavaScript, DOM, Fetch/XHR, etc.) rather than a specific technology.

### 2. Fetch API

**The Fetch API** is a modern **built-in browser API** that replaces the `XMLHttpRequest` object. It is Promise-based, making the code more concise and readable.

- **Features**:
  - Can be used without installing any separate libraries.
  - Being **Promise-based**, it works well with `async/await` syntax, making asynchronous code easier to manage.
  - It has become the web standard and is now more commonly used than AJAX.
- **JavaScript Example (using `async/await`)**:

  ```javascript
  async function getUser(id) {
    try {
      // Sends a GET request to the API (using **fetch**)
      const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${id}`);

      // Throws an error if the response is not successful
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
      }

      // Parses the response body as JSON
      const user = await response.json();
      console.log(user);
      return user;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Fetch error:", error);
    }
  }

  // Function call
  getUser(1);
  ```

### 3. WebSockets

**WebSockets** is a protocol that supports **bidirectional, real-time communication** between a client and a server.

- **Features**:
  - Once a connection is established, it remains open (Persistent Connection), allowing for free data exchange.
  - Enables **Server-Push**, where the server can send data to the client without a client request.
  - Used for applications requiring very low latency, such as real-time chat, online gaming, and stock tickers.

### 4. GraphQL

**GraphQL** is a **query language** for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries. It emerged as an alternative to the REST architecture.

- **Features**:
  - **Solves Over-fetching/Under-fetching**: Clients can request the exact data structure they need, eliminating unnecessary data transfer.
  - Allows flexible data requests for various data types through a single endpoint.
  - Manages API specifications with a strong type system.
- **JavaScript Example (using `fetch`)**:

```javascript
async function getProduct(id) {
  // The client defines the required data with a GraphQL query.
  const query = `
    query GetProductById($id: ID!) {
      product(id: $id) {
        id
        name
        price
        description
      }
    }
  `;

  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/graphql", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      // The query and variables are sent in the body.
      body: JSON.stringify({
        query: query,
        variables: { id: id },
      }),
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const result = await response.json();
    console.log(result.data.product);
    return result.data.product;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("GraphQL request error:", error);
  }
}

// Function call
getProduct("prod-123");
```
