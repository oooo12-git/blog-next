### Analysis and Prediction of Information Processing Engineer 2025 Round 2 Practical Exam Pass Rate

Looking at the Round 1 pass rates for each year, <span className="text-red-500">**the Information Processing Engineer practical exam pass rate falling below 20% in Round 1 was the first time in 2025**</span> (excluding 2020 immediately after the revision).

Accordingly, the 2025 Round 2 practical exam was set easier compared to Round 1. <span className="text-blue-500">**Considering the perceived difficulty and the examiners' goals, the 2025 Round 2 practical exam pass rate is expected to be around 25%.**</span> (The 2025 Round 2 Information Processing Engineer practical exam pass rate is scheduled to be announced on September 12th)

### Why the 2025 Round 1 Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Was Difficult

Looking at both annual pass rates and round-specific pass rates, we can infer why the 2025 Round 1 practical exam pass rate was particularly low compared to other years. From 2021 to 2022 and 2023, as theory questions decreased and programming questions increased, the problem composition changed, and **the examiners were able to achieve the desired pass rate of around 20%.**

  width={1024}
  height={1024}
  maxWidth={450}
/>

However, **in the 2024 Round 1 practical exam, difficulty control failed and the pass rate soared to 36.7%.** To lower the overall 2024 practical exam pass rate, the 2024 Round 2 and 3 practical exam questions were set more difficult than Round 1, but both rounds exceeded 20% pass rate, resulting in **an overall 2024 practical exam pass rate of 28.9%.**

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<span className="text-red-500">Due to the high pass rate in 2024, **it appears that in 2025, to achieve a pass rate of around 20%, they started by making Round 1 practical exam difficult, which has the highest number of applicants.**</span>

### Why the 2025 Round 2 Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Was Easier Than Round 1

Although the examiners made the 2025 Round 1 practical exam difficult, I don't think they wanted a low pass rate of 15%. They probably still wanted a pass rate of around 20%.

However, <span className="text-blue-500">**since Round 1 practical exam resulted in a lower 15% pass rate than the examiners expected, the 2025 Round 2 practical exam had to be set easier than Round 1.**</span>

To achieve a 20% pass rate for 2025 overall, **it is expected that the 2025 Round 2 practical exam was set to achieve around 25% pass rate.**

### Prediction for 2025 Round 3 Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Difficulty

If the 2025 Round 2 practical exam pass rate comes out around 25% as expected, the 2025 Round 3 practical exam is expected to be set at a similar difficulty to the 2024 Round 3 practical exam. The pass rate is also expected to be similarly around 25%.

## Information Processing Engineer Written Exam Pass Rate Trends

    { name: "2023", "Pass Rate": 59.0 },
    { name: "2024", "Pass Rate": 60.8 },
  ]}

The written exam has consistently maintained an average pass rate of **50% to 60%**. The Round 1 of 2021 recorded an exceptionally high pass rate of 82.08%. However, this appears to be a phenomenon that occurred during the difficulty adjustment process in the early stages of the revision. Overall, the written exam has a level where 5 to 6 out of 10 people pass, suggesting it's sufficiently passable with faithful study of basic concepts.

The practical exam has a significantly lower pass rate compared to the written exam, recording **an average of around 20%**. Immediately after the revision in 2020 Round 1, it recorded an extremely low pass rate of 5.3%. The highest was 2021 Round 1 at 39.5%. The 2024 average practical exam pass rate is 28.9%, which is on the high side. The 2025 Round 1 practical exam pass rate is 15.1%, which is on the low side considering historical pass rates.

### Should You Target the 2025 Round 3 Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam or the 2026 Round 1 Practical Exam?

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<span className="text-blue-500">**If the 2025 Round 2 practical exam pass rate is in the 25% range as expected**</span>, the 2025 Round 3 practical exam might be easier than the 2026 Round 1 practical exam. There's a high possibility that the examiners will tend to make Round 1 practical exams more difficult each year, unlike before.

However, <span className="text-red-500">**if the 2025 Round 2 practical exam pass rate comes out higher than expected around 30%**</span>, the 2026 Round 1 practical exam might be easier than the 2025 Round 3 practical exam. This is because the examiners are expected to make the 2025 Round 3 practical exam difficult due to the high 2025 Round 2 practical exam pass rate (though it will still be easier than 2025 Round 1).

### 2025 Round 2 Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Review

1. Programming problem difficulty decreased
2. Theory problem difficulty decreased
3. SQL query problems not included
4. C language/Java `for` loop eliminated
5. Programming 'easy' difficulty problems eliminated
