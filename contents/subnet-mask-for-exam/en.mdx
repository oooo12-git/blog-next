Subnet mask problems only cover IPv4 addresses, as IPv6 addresses would be too long.

An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits, divided into four 8-bit sections. Converting these bits (binary) to decimal results in the familiar IP address format.

Now, let's find the largest decimal number that can be represented with 8 bits.

$11111111_(2) = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 = 255$
