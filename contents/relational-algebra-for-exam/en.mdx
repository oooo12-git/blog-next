## What is Relational Algebra?

Relational algebra is a **procedural formal language** that describes how to find desired data in a relational database. It consists of a set of operations that take one or more relations (tables) as input and produce a new relation as a result.

<Details summary="Relational Algebra vs. Relational Calculus: Procedural vs. Non-Procedural Languages">
Database languages are broadly divided into **procedural languages** and **non-procedural (declarative) languages**.

- **Procedural Language**

  - Specifies **"How"** to access and retrieve data.
  - It describes the specific processing steps and sequence to obtain the desired result.
  - **Relational algebra** is a prime example. The order of operations, such as whether to perform a `SELECT` or a `JOIN` first, is defined.

- **Non-procedural Language**
  - Specifies only **"What"** is desired.
  - It declares only what result is wanted, leaving the specific method or procedure to the system (DBMS).
  - **Relational calculus** and **SQL** are prime examples. The user only specifies the conditions for the desired data, like `SELECT * FROM ... WHERE ...`, and the internal processing procedure is determined by the DBMS optimizer.

Therefore, you can understand relational algebra as a language centered on the 'process', while relational calculus is centered on the 'goal'.

## Relational Algebra Operators

Relational algebra operators are broadly divided into **general set operators** and **pure relational operators**.

### General Set Operators

Based on mathematical set theory, they require the two relations to be **Union-compatible**. (The two relations must have the same number of attributes, and the domains of corresponding attributes must be the same).

| Operator          | Symbol | Description                                                                       |
| :---------------- | :----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Union             |   ‚à™    | Returns a relation containing all tuples from both relations (duplicates excluded). |
| Intersection      |   ‚à©    | Returns a relation consisting only of tuples that exist in both relations.        |
| Difference        |   -    | Returns tuples that are in the first relation but not in the second.              |
| Cartesian Product |   √ó    | Returns all possible tuples by pairing tuples from two relations.                 |

### Pure Relational Operators

These are operators created specifically for the relational database model.

| Operator          | Symbol | Description                                                                               |
| :---------------- | :----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Select            |   œÉ    | Returns a horizontal subset of tuples (rows) that satisfy a given condition.              |
| Project           |   œÄ    | Returns a vertical subset of attributes (columns), with duplicates excluded.              |
| Join              |   ‚ãà    | Combines two relations based on a common attribute to create a new relation.              |
| Division          |   √∑    | Returns tuples from relation A that are related to all tuples in relation B.              |
