> Recently, security issues have become a major social concern.
>
> - With the constant leakage of personal information and the widespread use of AI-powered voice coding, interest in security issues is growing.
> - Accordingly, security problems will be a major topic in the Information Processing Engineer practical exam.
> - Server access control and authentication are widely used in practice.
> - Using proper authentication is crucial for network security, so this topic is highly likely to be on the exam.

| Category | Description | Importance in Defending Against Network Attacks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Server Access Control** | Policies and procedures that restrict access to system resources to authorized users only. | **(DAC, MAC, RBAC)** Prevents unauthorized system intrusion and misuse of privileges by insiders to protect critical information. |
| **3A** | Identifies users and tracks their activities through **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting**. | **(Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)** Essential for detecting abnormal activities and tracing the cause of security incidents by recording who, what, when, and how resources were used. |
| **Authentication Technologies** | Various techniques to verify a user's identity. | **(SSO, Kerberos, OAuth)** Secure authentication procedures prevent attackers from impersonating other users, stopping data breaches and system takeovers. |
