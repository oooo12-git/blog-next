## Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Theory Problem Examples by Difficulty Level

For those who want to experience the difficulty of the Information Processing Engineer practical exam, we provide past problems divided into high, medium, and low difficulty levels.
By solving theory problems at different difficulty levels, you can **gauge how much time you should invest in theory problems**.

### High Difficulty - Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Past Problems

> ❗️High difficulty problems are new types or past problem variations that are challenging, or difficult types among theory problems.

<ProblemAnswer
  problem="Given a host address of 223.13.234.132 and subnet mask of 255.255.255.192, what values go in the parentheses?
  The network address of this host is 223.13.234.( (1) ).
  The number of available host addresses in this network, excluding network and broadcast addresses, is ( (2) ).
  "
  correctAnswer="(1): 128, (2): 62"
  examSessions={["[Practical]2025-2nd"]}
/>

This problem is a variation of past problems. Subnet mask-related problems tend to feel more difficult compared to other past problem variations.

However, if you understand the concepts of subnet masks and IP addresses well, this was an easily solvable problem.

Information Processing Engineer practical exam theory problems can be solved easily even when they correspond to "high" difficulty.

### Medium Difficulty - Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Past Problems

> ❗️Medium difficulty problems are past problem variations or new types that deal with commonly covered theoretical terms.

<ProblemAnswer
  problem="Attack method exploiting vulnerabilities in 3-way handshake
  What is the attack method where an attacker acts as a client, sends numerous SYN packets to the server, then deliberately doesn't send the final ACK, keeping the server in a connection waiting state?"
  correctAnswer="SYN Flooding"
  examSessions={["[Practical]2025-2nd"]}
/>

This problem is a new type but requires matching commonly covered theoretical terms. It's a problem you can adequately prepare for by studying theory.

### Low Difficulty - Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Past Problems

> ❗️Low difficulty problems are identical to past problems or simple variations of past problems.

What is the result of performing the $\pi_{TTL}(EMPLOYEE)$ operation on the following EMPLOYEE table?

EMPLOYEE Table

| EMPNO | NAME          | DEPT            | TTL               |
| :---- | :------------ | :-------------- | :---------------- |
| 1001  | Hong Gil-dong | General Affairs | Manager           |
| 1002  | Lee Soon-shin | Sales           | Section Chief     |
| 1003  | Gang Gam-chan | Development     | Assistant Manager |

      <TableRow>
        <TableHead className="text-center">(1)</TableHead>
      </TableRow>
    </TableHeader>
    <TableBody>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell className="text-center">(2)</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell className="text-center">(3)</TableCell>

      <TableRow>
        <TableCell className="text-center">(4)</TableCell>
      </TableRow>
    </TableBody>
  </Table>
</div>

<ProblemAnswer
  problem="Write the values that go in 1, 2, 3, 4."
  correctAnswer="1: TTL, 2: Manager, 3: Section Chief, 4: Assistant Manager"
  examSessions={["[Practical]2025-2nd", "[Practical]2022-2nd"]}
/>

This problem is identical to a previous past problem. If you solved past problems, it would be difficult to get this wrong.

If you know what the relational algebra symbol Project means, you can easily solve this problem.

The Information Processing Engineer 2025 2nd session practical exam theory problems had one fewer <span className="text-red-500">"high"</span> difficulty problem and one more <span className="text-blue-500">"low"</span> difficulty problem compared to the 1st session. The difficulty was adjusted downward.

The table below summarizes all theory problems and their difficulty levels for the Information Processing Engineer practical exam 2025 1st and 2nd sessions. Look through it to check the difficulty levels.
