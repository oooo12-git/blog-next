## üìä Summary of Database Integrity Types

Database integrity means maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and validity of data. Various constraints are used to enhance the reliability of the database.

| Type                             | **Core Keyword**             | **Description**                                                                             |
| :------------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Entity Integrity**             | `PRIMARY KEY`                | The primary key cannot contain `NULL` values and must be unique within the relation.        |
| **Referential Integrity**        | `FOREIGN KEY`                | A foreign key value must match a primary key value in the referenced relation or be `NULL`. |
| **Attribute (Domain) Integrity** | `DOMAIN`, `CHECK`, `DEFAULT` | Attribute values must belong to a defined domain (data type, range, etc.).                  |
| **User-Defined Integrity**       | `TRIGGER`                    | Integrity conditions defined by the user to fit specific business rules.                    |
| **Key Integrity**                | `UNIQUE`                     | No two tuples in a relation can have the same key value.                                    |

## 1. Entity Integrity

**Entity integrity** is a constraint that ensures every tuple (row) in a relation can be uniquely identified. It uses a **Primary Key**, which must satisfy two conditions:

1.  It **cannot have a `NULL` value.** (Not Null)
2.  It must have a **unique value** within the relation. (Unique)

- **Example**: If `student_id` is set as the primary key in a `Student` table, every student must have a unique ID, and no student data can exist without one.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    major VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

## 2. Referential Integrity

**Referential integrity** is a constraint that ensures the relationship between two relations remains valid. It is enforced using a **Foreign Key**, which must either be one of the **primary key** values from the referenced relation or be `NULL`.

- **Example**: The `student_id` in the `Enrollment` table is a foreign key that references the `student_id` in the `Student` table. Therefore, any `student_id` entered into the `Enrollment` table must already exist in the `Student` table. You cannot enter enrollment information for a non-existent student.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_code VARCHAR(10),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Student(student_id)
);
```

---

## 3. Attribute (Domain) Integrity

**Attribute (Domain) integrity** is a constraint that ensures each attribute (column) value in a relation belongs to a valid range of values (a domain). It can be set using data types, `NULL` constraints, default values, and `CHECK` constraints.

- **Example**: In a `Student` table, you can enforce that the `gpa` attribute only accepts numbers between 0.0 and 4.5, and that `gender` can only be 'Male' or 'Female'.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(10) CHECK(gender IN ('Male', 'Female')),
    gpa DECIMAL(2, 1) CHECK(gpa BETWEEN 0.0 AND 4.5),
    registration_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);
```

---

## 4. User-Defined Integrity

**User-defined integrity** is a set of constraints defined by the user to enforce specific business rules or organizational policies in the database. It is often implemented using **Triggers**.

- **Example**: You can create a rule where if a product's stock in the `Products` table drops below 10, its information is automatically added to the `Reorder` table.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER low_stock_alert
AFTER UPDATE ON Products
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.stock < 10 THEN
        INSERT INTO Reorder (product_code, request_date) VALUES (NEW.product_code, NOW());
    END IF;
END;
```

---

## 5. Key Integrity

**Key integrity** is a constraint that ensures every tuple in a relation has a unique key value. While the Primary Key constraint covers both entity and key integrity, the `UNIQUE` constraint can be used to enforce uniqueness on non-primary key attributes as well.

- **Example**: In a `Members` table, the `email` is not the primary key, but you can set a `UNIQUE` constraint to ensure that every member has a different email address.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Members (
    member_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```
