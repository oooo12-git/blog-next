## **The Birth of Foundation Models**

Foundation models (commonly known as Generative AI), which serve as the basis for solving various problems, have emerged.

### **Model? Parameters?**

> Model = Function = Program: A form that produces output when given input.

AI models are trained to become functions (y=ax+b) that probabilistically approach numerous correct answers (data).

To get close to abundant and diverse data, much more complex functions than linear functions are needed.

A linear function has the form:

$y = ax + b$

In this form, a and b are called parameters.

A quadratic function has the following form:

$y= ax^2+ bx + c$

Here, a, b, and c are parameters.

Linear functions have 2 parameters, quadratic functions have 3 parameters...

As functions become more complex, parameters gradually increase.

(ChatGPT has 175 billion parameters.

That means it's essentially a (175 billion-1) degree function.

+When an AI model is called 'large' or 'giant', it usually refers to having many parameters.)

Since AI models consist of functions that humans cannot create,

they can show surprisingly close answers to complex data (correct answers) compared to models logically created by humans (at most 3rd-degree functions).

However, how AI can find parameters with better correct answers has not been revealed.

This is not a mathematically proven or clearly established principle.

## **How Does Pre-training Work?**

In the past, there were only AI models for solving individual problems.

(e.g., AI models like DeepMind's AlphaGo that specialize in solving Go problems.)

To create Foundation models that are general-purpose models capable of solving various problems, pre-training is necessary.

After creating Foundation models through pre-training,

to solve specific problems more appropriately using these models

(more accurately, more creatively, more logically, depending on the problem)

Adaptation (= Fine Tuning) is required.

Unlike the past, AI learning stages are now divided into two stages,

and super-large AI is a Foundation model focused on pretraining (with an enormous amount of pre-training).

As shown in the figure below, AI learns by masking and predicting words.

This learning is repeated with large amounts of data.

This is pre-training.

## **Why Has AI Become Smarter Than Before?**

1.  Much more training data was used than before.
    1.  Previously, it was difficult to train on large amounts of data because learning data had to be shown and tested one by one by humans.
    2.  However, now AI can perform this learning by itself using Reward Models (RM), making it possible to train on much more data than before.
2.  Much larger models (models with more parameters) were used than before.

Therefore, these giant AI models that have learned from massive amounts of data are called "Super-large AI."

Super-large AI, thanks to the aforementioned

1. Enormous amount of data learning and

2. Model size

can show us answers that match the context of examples (prompts) even after seeing few examples (Few-shot).

However, the better the contextually appropriate examples provided, the better answers AI can provide - the answers people want.

This is why the job category of Prompt Engineer has emerged.

AI can also provide answers in situations without examples, which is called "Zero-Shot."

ChatGPT has never learned about law, business, or medicine, but it's smart enough to pass bar exams, CPA, MBA, and medical license exams.

### **Must AI Be Giant to Be Smart?**

Super-large AI with enormously large models and massive pre-training data.

In 2021, DeepMind questioned whether enormously large models with many parameters are fully utilizing their capabilities.

They decided to reduce the model size to one-fourth and increase training data four times to conduct pre-training and compare performance.

This way, they could train with the same computing power (= money, cost) investment as before.

As a result, smaller models with more training data showed superior capabilities.

The smaller the model size, the lower the service operation costs.

This will enable more people to use AI more affordably in various fields.

Through DeepMind's attempt, we learned that there's room for further optimization of AI models.

### **Small Models, Abundant Training Data**

The largest AI model among Facebook's released LLAMA has about 65 billion parameters.

(ChatGPT has 175 billion parameters.)

LLAMA AI costs less to operate because it's smaller than ChatGPT.

However, LLAMA AI doesn't necessarily show lower performance than ChatGPT.

If LLAMA AI were trained with sufficient amounts of data, it could perform better than ChatGPT.

Artificial intelligence technology is being optimized toward creating efficient AI models using small models and abundant training data.
