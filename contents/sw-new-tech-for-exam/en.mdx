> üí° **New Software Technologies** is a section where questions often reflect the latest IT trends. Rather than memorizing individual technologies, understanding the **fundamental principles** that are changing the modern software development paradigm, like **Microservice Architecture (MSA)** or **Digital Twin**, will allow you to grasp multiple related technologies at once.

## üí° 3 Fundamental Principles Changing the SW Paradigm

Just as 'Ad-hoc Networks' are fundamental to networking, the software field has core principles that form the basis for numerous other technologies.

| Technology (Technology)                 | Core Principle                                                                           | Derived/Related Tech                                     |
| :-------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Microservice Architecture (MSA)**     | **Decomposition & Autonomy**: Breaking down a monolith into small, independent units     | Cloud Native, DevOps, Containers, Serverless             |
| **CPS & Digital Twin**                  | **Connection & Synchronization**: 1:1 linking and syncing of physical and virtual worlds | Smart Factory, Autonomous Driving, Simulation, Metaverse |
| **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** | **Reuse & Composition**: Developing by composing 'services'                              | Microservices, Mashups, API Economy                      |

### 1. Microservice Architecture (MSA)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="Core Principle: An architectural approach to develop a single, large application as a suite of small, independently deployable services.">
  - **Concept**: Each service can have its own database and communicates with other services via APIs. It's like building a large structure by combining different Lego blocks (features).
  - **Why it's fundamental**: This structure enables **rapid development speed, high scalability, and flexible technology choices**. A failure in one service doesn't lead to a total system failure, which is advantageous for **fault isolation**. It has become the standard for developing and operating applications in a cloud environment.
  - **Relationship with SOA**: It inherits the philosophy of SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) but is a more practical and advanced form that further reduces the coupling between services (loose coupling) and maximizes independence.
</Details>

### 2. CPS (Cyber-Physical System) & Digital Twin

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="Core Principle: A technology that replicates physical objects and processes of the real world into the virtual world, synchronizing them by exchanging data in real-time.">
  - **Concept**:
    - **CPS**: A broad system framework where physical world objects are controlled by sensors, and data collected in cyberspace is used for analysis and decision-making to control the physical world again.
    - **Digital Twin**: A core technology for implementing CPS. It creates an identical **twin** of a real machine, equipment, or factory in a virtual space. Data from the real world is instantly reflected in the virtual model, and simulation results from the virtual model can be applied back to the real world.
  - **Why it's fundamental**: It allows for simulations that are impossible in the real world (e.g., testing a full factory shutdown) to be performed in the virtual world to **predict the future** and find **optimal operational strategies**. It is a foundational technology driving innovation in almost every industry, including manufacturing, construction, healthcare, and urban planning.
</Details>

### 3. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="Core Principle: An architectural style that structures an enterprise's IT systems as a collection of reusable 'services', which are combined (orchestrated) to implement business processes.">
  - **Concept**: Each service exposes its functionality to the outside world through a standardized interface (usually a web service). Services are often connected and managed centrally through an 'Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)'.
  - **Why it's fundamental**: It formally introduced the concept of 'reusing functions like components' into software architecture. This provided the philosophical basis for the emergence of later technologies like **Microservice Architecture (MSA)** and **Mashups**.

## üíª Detailed Technology Explanations

### Architecture

#### Microservice Architecture (MSA)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="An architecture for building a large application as a combination of small, independent services.">
- **Features**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Services communicate primarily through APIs, and a failure in one service does not affect the entire system.
- **Pros**: High flexibility and scalability, rapid deployment speed, team autonomy.
- **Cons**: Increased overall system complexity, difficulties in distributed system management, complex testing and debugging.
</Details>

#### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="An architecture that builds systems by composing reusable service units.">
- **Features**: Often uses web service technologies (WSDL, SOAP, UDDI) and frequently employs a centralized approach for service integration via an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).
- **Difference from MSA**: Services in SOA are typically larger than in MSA, and communication via an ESB can lead to relatively tighter coupling between services.
</Details>

### Physical-Virtual Convergence

#### CPS (Cyber-Physical System)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="An integrated system that controls physical elements of the real world through computers and networks.">
- **Components**: Sensors (data collection), Actuators (physical control), Network (communication), Computing (analysis/decision).
- **Features**: Aims for autonomous control and optimization through a tight feedback loop between the physical and virtual worlds.
</Details>

#### Digital Twin

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="A virtual model that is an identical replica of a real-world object or system.">
- **Features**: Real-world data is reflected in the virtual model in real-time for synchronization. This allows for simulations, analysis, and predictions that are difficult in the real world, with results applied back to reality.
- **Applications**: Smart factories, aircraft engine maintenance, urban planning.
</Details>

#### Metaverse, VR, AR, MR

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="Virtual/Augmented/Mixed Reality technologies and platforms that allow users to interact with a sense of immersion.">
- **VR (Virtual Reality)**: Immersion in a 100% computer-generated environment.
- **AR (Augmented Reality)**: Overlays virtual information or images onto the real world (e.g., Pok√©mon Go).
- **MR (Mixed Reality)**: Real and virtual objects interact and influence each other.
- **Metaverse**: A 3D virtual world where social, economic, and cultural activities take place using these technologies.
