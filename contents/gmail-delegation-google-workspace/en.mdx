### ‚úÖ Verify Delegation Setup Complete

**Delegatee verification method:**

#### 13. To check if email delegation is working, the recipient should click the profile photo button in the upper right

    <ImageWithCaption

      alt="Click profile photo button in upper right"
      caption="Click profile photo button in upper right"
      width={2864}
      height={1442}
    />

#### 14. Check if there are any delegated accounts.

    <ImageWithCaption

      alt="Verify delegated account list"
      caption="Verify delegated account list"
      width={902}
      height={1258}
    />

**Delegator verification method:**

#### 15. To check if email delegation is working from the delegating account, go to Settings > Accounts > Grant access to your account > Check if 'Accepted' status appears next to the recipient's email.

    <ImageWithCaption
      src="/contents/gmail-delegation-google-workspace/gmail-delegation-step16-check-accepted-status-delegation-settings-google-workspace.png"
      alt="Check accepted status in Grant access to your account list"
      caption="Check accepted status in Grant access to your account list"
      width={2844}
      height={1412}
    />

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. However, the account that receives email delegation does not receive notifications when new emails arrive.

For example, let's say kimjaahyun@kimjaahyun.com email is delegated to example@kimjaahyun.com email.

Even if new emails come to kimjaahyun@kimjaahyun.com, example@kimjaahyun.com will not receive notifications.

There are 2 ways to solve this.

### üìß Email Delegation Notification Solution 1: Auto Forward

**üéØ Method summary:**  
When new emails come to kimjaahyun@kimjaahyun.com, automatically forward these emails to example@kimjaahyun.com. This way example@kimjaahyun.com will receive notifications.

**‚úÖ Advantage:**

- Simple.

**‚ùå Disadvantage:**  
While example@kimjaahyun.com was hoping to handle emails from kimjaahyun@kimjaahyun.com, auto-forwarding allows example@kimjaahyun.com to see all content, so example@kimjaahyun.com might not bother checking emails from kimjaahyun@kimjaahyun.com.

**‚ö†Ô∏è This leads to:**

1. **Processing status mismatch**: example@kimjaahyun.com has already processed the email, but when kimjaahyun@kimjaahyun.com checks, it remains unprocessed.
2. **Risk of double processing**: kimjaahyun@kimjaahyun.com might process the email twice.
3. **Work confusion**: Work confusion occurs.

<Details summary="üí° Example of Double Email Processing">

1. A customer inquiry about a purchase arrived at kimjaahyun@kimjaahyun.com.
2. The email was automatically forwarded to example@kimjaahyun.com through the auto-forwarding setting.
3. E, who manages example@kimjaahyun.com, read and replied to the email from the example@kimjaahyun.com inbox.
4. In the kimjaahyun@kimjaahyun.com inbox, the email remains in an unprocessed state.
5. K, the person in charge of kimjaahyun@kimjaahyun.com, later checked the email and replied to the customer to process it.
6. The customer received two different replies.
7. K and E later realized they had processed the email twice, wasting time.

Below is how to set up auto-forwarding in Gmail.

### üîî Email Delegation Notification Solution 2: Mail Echo for Gmail

#### üéØ Method Summary:

`Mail Echo for Gmail` is an open-source solution that utilizes the Gmail API to send real-time notifications when a new email arrives in a delegated account. The delegate (`A_mail@company.com`) does not receive the email body itself, but rather a notification email such as, "A new email has arrived at sales@company.com."

#### ‚úÖ Advantages:

*   **Separation of Duties**: It encourages handling actual work within the delegated `sales@company.com` mailbox, preventing work confusion.
*   **Real-time Notifications**: Using Google Cloud infrastructure (Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions), notifications are received almost in real-time upon new email arrival.
*   **Security**: Since the email body is not forwarded, the risk of exposing sensitive information is reduced.
*   **Automation**: The entire infrastructure is managed by Terraform code, simplifying installation and setup.

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages:

*   **Initial Setup Complexity**: Requires an understanding of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and you must deploy the infrastructure yourself using Terraform.
*   **GCP Costs**: A small GCP usage fee may be incurred if the Free Tier is exceeded.

`Mail Echo for Gmail` is an open-source project I developed to complement the shortcomings of email delegation and enhance work efficiency. You can find more details and install it yourself from the GitHub repository below.
