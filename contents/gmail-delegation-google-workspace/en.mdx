‚è∞ **The instructions say it may take up to 30 minutes, but it often works immediately.**

### ‚úÖ Verifying the Delegation Setup

#### **How the Delegate Can Verify:**

#### Step 13: To check if the email delegation is active, the delegate should click on their profile picture in the top right corner.

    <ImageWithCaption
      src="/contents/gmail-delegation-google-workspace/gmail-delegation-step14-check-profile-button-delegate-verification-google-workspace.png"
      alt="Click the profile picture button in the top right"
      caption="Click the profile picture button in the top right"
      width={2864}
      height={1442}
    />

#### Step 14: Check if the delegated account is listed.

    <ImageWithCaption
      src="/contents/gmail-delegation-google-workspace/gmail-delegation-step15-verify-delegated-account-list-google-workspace.png"
      alt="Verify the delegated account list"
      caption="Verify the delegated account list"
      width={902}
      height={1258}
    />

#### **How the Delegator Can Verify:**

#### Step 15: Check for the `Accepted` status next to the delegate's email.

To confirm the delegation from the delegator's account, go to Settings > Accounts > Grant access to your account, and check if the status next to the delegate's email is `Accepted`.

    <ImageWithCaption
      src="/contents/gmail-delegation-google-workspace/gmail-delegation-step16-check-accepted-status-delegation-settings-google-workspace.png"
      alt="Check for Accepted status in the Grant access to your account list"
      caption="Check for Accepted status in the Grant access to your account list"
      width={2844}
      height={1412}
    />

## ‚ö†Ô∏è However, the delegated account does not receive notifications for new emails.

For example, let's say the `sales@company.com` email is delegated to Administrator A's email, `A_mail@company.com`.

When a new email arrives at `sales@company.com`, no notification is sent to `A_mail@company.com`.

There are two ways to solve this.

### üìß Solution 1: Auto-Forwarding

#### **üéØ Summary:**

When a new email arrives at `sales@company.com`, it is automatically forwarded to `A_mail@company.com`. This ensures that `A_mail@company.com` receives a notification.

#### **‚úÖ Advantages:**

It's simple to set up.

#### **‚ùå Disadvantages:**

Administrator A is supposed to manage emails directly from the `sales@company.com` mailbox. However, auto-forwarding allows them to see all emails in their personal `A_mail@company.com` inbox. As a result, Administrator A may not feel the need to access the `sales@company.com` mailbox and might reply from their own account.

**‚ö†Ô∏è This can lead to several problems:**

<ImageWithCaption
  src="/contents/gmail-delegation-google-workspace/gmail-delegation-auto-forwarding-issue-comic.png"
  alt="Comic illustrating the problems of auto-forwarding"
  caption="Comic illustrating the problems of auto-forwarding"
  width={2844}
  height={1412}
/>

1.  **Status Mismatch**: Even if Administrator A reads and replies to an email from `A_mail@company.com`, the email in the `sales@company.com` mailbox will remain marked as 'unread'.
2.  **Risk of Double Processing**: Another team member managing the `sales@company.com` mailbox might see the unread email and reply again, leading to duplicate responses.
3.  **Work Confusion**: It becomes difficult to track who has handled which email, causing confusion.

Below are the instructions for setting up auto-forwarding in Gmail (link to be added).

### üîî Solution 2: Mail Echo for Gmail

<ImageWithCaption

  alt="Mail Echo for Gmail Logo"
  caption="Mail Echo for Gmail: The notification solution for delegated Gmail accounts"
  width={771}
  height={637}
/>

Mail Echo for Gmail is a service that sends a notification email to the delegate's account when a new email arrives in the delegated account. This notification email includes a convenient link that takes you directly to the delegated mailbox.

Let's revisit the example of the `sales@company.com` account delegated to Administrator A (`A_mail@company.com`).

When a new email arrives at `sales@company.com`, Mail Echo sends a 'New Mail Notification' to `A_mail@company.com`.

<ImageWithCaption
  src="/contents/gmail-delegation-google-workspace/mail-echo-alarm-iphone.png"
  alt="Mail Echo for Gmail Notification"
  caption="Mail Echo for Gmail Notification"
  width={1143}
  height={842}
/>

Administrator A can simply click the link in the notification email to be taken directly to the `sales@company.com` mailbox to handle the task.

<ImageWithCaption
  src="/contents/gmail-delegation-google-workspace/mail-echo-linkbutton.png"
  alt="Mail Echo for Gmail Link Button"
  caption="Clicking the Mail Echo for Gmail link button takes you to the delegated mailbox"
  width={2074}
  height={1236}
/>

#### ‚úÖ Advantages:

1.  **Real-time Notifications**: The delegated account receives timely notifications for new emails.
2.  **Quick Access to Tasks**: The link in the notification email allows for one-click access to the delegated account (`sales@company.com`), speeding up response times.
3.  **Shared Status and Transparency**: All work is handled directly within the delegated account, so the read/unread status and reply history are transparent to all team members. This prevents the confusion and duplicate work that can occur with auto-forwarding.
