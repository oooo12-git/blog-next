## üí° What is the `chmod` command?

`chmod`, short for 'change mode', is a command in Linux and Unix-like operating systems used to **change the access permissions of files or directories**. In the Information Processing Engineer practical exam, you are often asked to grant specific permissions and construct the command using octal notation.

## üîë Types and Targets of Access Permissions

To understand `chmod`, you first need to know the types of permissions and to whom they apply.

### 1. Types of Permissions

| Permission  | Symbol | Description                                                       | Octal Value |
| :---------- | :----: | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------: |
| **Read**    |  `r`   | Read file content or view directory listings                      |    **4**    |
| **Write**   |  `w`   | Modify/delete file content, or create/delete files in a directory |    **2**    |
| **Execute** |  `x`   | Execute a file or access a directory (`cd`)                       |    **1**    |

### 2. Permission Targets

| Target     | Symbol | Description                   |
| :--------- | :----: | :---------------------------- |
| **User**   |  `u`   | The user who owns the file    |
| **Group**  |  `g`   | The group the file belongs to |
| **Others** |  `o`   | All other users               |

## üî¢ Setting Permissions with Octal Notation

The core of the `chmod` command is its octal notation. You create a permission combination by adding the numeric values assigned to each permission (r, w, x).

- **r (Read)** = 4
- **w (Write)** = 2
- **x (Execute)** = 1

For example, read and write permissions (`rw-`) are `4 + 2 = 6`.

| Octal | Permission Combination (`rwx`) | Description                   |
| :---: | :----------------------------: | :---------------------------- |
| **7** |             `rwx`              | Full read, write, and execute |
| **6** |             `rw-`              | Read and write                |
| **5** |             `r-x`              | Read and execute              |
| **4** |             `r--`              | Read-only                     |
| **3** |             `-wx`              | Write and execute             |
| **2** |             `-w-`              | Write-only                    |
| **1** |             `--x`              | Execute-only                  |
| **0** |             `---`              | No permissions                |

The command is structured as **`chmod [user][group][others] [filename]`**. For example, `chmod 754 file.txt` means:

- **User (7)**: `rwx` (read+write+execute)
- **Group (5)**: `r-x` (read+execute)
- **Others (4)**: `r--` (read-only)

## üìù Practice Problems for the Information Processing Engineer Exam

### Problem 1

<ProblemAnswer
  problem="On a Linux system, you need to change the access permissions for `report.txt` as follows. Complete the `chmod` command using octal notation.

- User: Read and write permissions
- Group: Read permission
- Others: No permissions"
  correctAnswer="chmod 640 report.txt"
  />

<Details summary="Problem Solution">

Convert the permissions for each target into octal numbers.

1.  **User**: Read(4) + Write(2) = **6**
2.  **Group**: Read(4) = **4**
3.  **Others**: No permissions = **0**

Combining these numbers gives `640`. Therefore, the full command is:

```bash
chmod 640 report.txt
```

</Details>

### Problem 2

<ProblemAnswer
  problem="There is a shell script file named `script.sh`. The file's owner should have all permissions, while the group and others should only have read and execute permissions. Write the `chmod` command to set these permissions."
  correctAnswer="chmod 755 script.sh"
/>

<Details summary="Problem Solution">

Convert the permissions for each target into octal numbers.

1.  **User**: Read(4) + Write(2) + Execute(1) = **7**
2.  **Group**: Read(4) + Execute(1) = **5**
3.  **Others**: Read(4) + Execute(1) = **5**

Combining these numbers gives `755`. Therefore, the full command is:

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```
