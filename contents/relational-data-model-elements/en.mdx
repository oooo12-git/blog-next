<Details summary="ü§î What is a Relational Data Model?">

When you start studying databases, the first concept you'll encounter is the **Relational Data Model**. üóÉÔ∏è It's the most widely used data model, representing data in the form of 2D tables called **Relations**.

Think of it like an Excel sheet, where data is stored and managed in a table composed of rows and columns. This structure makes the data intuitive to understand and easy to handle using a standardized method like SQL.

### üìä Core Components of the Relational Data Model

| Term (English)  | Description                                                                                                        | Example (Student Relation)                                         |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relation**    | The 2D table itself, composed of rows and columns.                                                                 | The entire 'Student' table.                                        |
| **Tuple**       | Each **row** in a relation. A set of related data, like a single student's information.                            | A single row: (1001, 'John Doe', 'Computer Science')               |
| **Attribute**   | Each **column** in a relation. The smallest logical unit of data.                                                  | The 'StudentID', 'Name', and 'Major' columns.                      |
| **Cardinality** | The **number of tuples** (rows) in a relation.                                                                     | If there are 3 students, the cardinality is 3.                     |
| **Degree**      | The **number of attributes** (columns) in a relation.                                                              | With 3 attributes ('StudentID', 'Name', 'Major'), the degree is 3. |
| **Schema**      | A specification of the database's **structure and constraints**. Defines the relation name, attributes, and types. | Student(<u>StudentID</u>:Integer, Name:String, Major:String)       |
| **Instance**    | The **actual data set** within a relation at a specific point in time.                                             | All student data currently stored in the 'Student' table.          |
| **Identifier**  | An attribute or set of attributes that uniquely identifies each tuple (e.g., candidate key, primary key).          | The 'StudentID' attribute.                                         |
| **Domain**      | The **set of possible values** an attribute can have (e.g., the domain for 'Gender' is \{'Male', 'Female'\}).      | The domain for 'Year' could be \{1, 2, 3, 4\}.                     |
