## üìà What is Database Normalization?

**Normalization** is the process of systematically decomposing tables to minimize data redundancy and ensure data integrity in a relational database. Normalization helps prevent anomalies and improves the stability and maintainability of the data structure.

- **Anomalies**: Problems that can occur due to data redundancy.
  - **Insertion Anomaly**: The inability to insert desired data without some other unnecessary data.
  - **Deletion Anomaly**: The loss of unintended data when certain information is deleted.
  - **Update Anomaly**: Data inconsistency that occurs when only some of the redundant data is updated.

## üîë Functional Dependency

To understand normalization, you must first grasp the concept of **Functional Dependency**.

In a relation, if the value of attribute A uniquely determines the value of attribute B, we say "attribute B is functionally dependent on attribute A," denoted as `A ‚Üí B`. Here, A is the **Determinant**, and B is the **Dependent**.

- **Full Functional Dependency**: The dependent is determined by the entire primary key, not by any part of it. (Key to 2NF)
- **Partial Functional Dependency**: The dependent is determined by a part of the primary key.
- **Transitive Functional Dependency**: If `A ‚Üí B` and `B ‚Üí C`, then `A ‚Üí C` holds. (Key to 3NF)

## üî¢ Summary of Normalization Stages

| Normal Form | **Core Condition** | **Target for Elimination** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1NF (First Normal Form)** | All attribute values must be **atomic**. | Multi-valued attributes |
| **2NF (Second Normal Form)** | Must be in 1NF and eliminate **partial functional dependencies**. (Full functional dependency) | Partial functional dependencies |
| **3NF (Third Normal Form)** | Must be in 2NF and eliminate **transitive functional dependencies**. | Transitive functional dependencies |
| **BCNF (Boyce-Codd NF)** | Must be in 3NF and every **determinant must be a candidate key**. | Determinants that are not candidate keys |
| **4NF (Fourth Normal Form)** | Must be in BCNF and eliminate **multi-valued dependencies**. | Multi-valued dependencies |
| **5NF (Fifth Normal Form)** | Must be in 4NF and uses **join dependencies**. | Join dependencies |

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ First Normal Form (1NF)

**First Normal Form** requires that all attribute values in a relation be **atomic**. This means a single attribute cannot hold multiple values.

- **Example**: If you store the courses a student is taking, putting multiple values like 'Data Structures, Algorithms' in a `Courses` attribute violates 1NF.

**[Before Normalization]**

| StudentID | Name | Courses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1001 | John Doe | Data Structures, Algorithms |
| 1002 | Jane Smith | Operating Systems |

**[After 1NF Normalization]**

| StudentID | Name | Course |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1001 | John Doe | Data Structures |
| 1001 | John Doe | Algorithms |
| 1002 | Jane Smith | Operating Systems |

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Second Normal Form** requires that the relation is in 1NF and all **partial functional dependencies** are removed. This means all non-key attributes must be **fully functionally dependent** on the entire primary key. (If the primary key is a single attribute, the relation is always in 2NF).

- **Example**: In a course registration relation with `(StudentID, CourseID)` as the primary key, `Grade` depends on both `(StudentID, CourseID)`, but `ProfessorName` depends only on `CourseID` (a partial functional dependency).

**[Before Normalization] (Primary Key: StudentID, CourseID)**

| StudentID | CourseID | ProfessorName | Grade |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1001 | CS101 | Prof. Kim | A+ |
| 1001 | CS202 | Prof. Lee | A0 |
| 1002 | CS101 | Prof. Kim | B+ |

**[After 2NF Normalization]**

**[Registration Table]**

| StudentID | CourseID | Grade |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1001 | CS101 | A+ |
| 1001 | CS202 | A0 |
| 1002 | CS101 | B+ |

**[Course Table]**

| CourseID | ProfessorName |
| :--- | :--- |
| CS101 | Prof. Kim |
| CS202 | Prof. Lee |

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Third Normal Form** requires that the relation is in 2NF and all **transitive functional dependencies** are removed. A transitive dependency exists when `A ‚Üí B` and `B ‚Üí C`, which leads to `A ‚Üí C`.

- **Example**: If `StudentID ‚Üí DepartmentID` and `DepartmentID ‚Üí DepartmentName`, then there is a transitive dependency `StudentID ‚Üí DepartmentName`.

**[Before Normalization] (Primary Key: StudentID)**

| StudentID | Name | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1001 | John Doe | CS | Computer Science |
| 1002 | Jane Smith | EE | Electrical Engineering |
| 1003 | Peter Pan | CS | Computer Science |

**[After 3NF Normalization]**

**[Student Table]**

| StudentID | Name | DepartmentID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1001 | John Doe | CS |
| 1002 | Jane Smith | EE |
| 1003 | Peter Pan | CS |

**[Department Table]**

| DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| :--- | :--- |
| CS | Computer Science |
| EE | Electrical Engineering |

---

## BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)

**BCNF** is a stricter version of 3NF. It requires that for every functional dependency, the **determinant must be a candidate key**. It addresses certain rare anomalies not handled by 3NF.

- **Example**: In a relation where `(StudentID, Course)` is a candidate key, if there's a constraint that a professor can only teach one course (`Professor ‚Üí Course`), then `Professor` is a determinant but not a candidate key. This violates BCNF.

**[Before Normalization] (Candidate Key: (StudentID, Course))**

| StudentID | Course | Professor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1001 | Data Structures | Prof. Kim |
| 1002 | Data Structures | Prof. Kim |
| 1001 | Algorithms | Prof. Lee |

**[After BCNF Normalization]**

**[Enrollment Table]**

| StudentID | Professor |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1001 | Prof. Kim |
| 1002 | Prof. Kim |
| 1001 | Prof. Lee |

**[ProfessorCourse Table]**

| Professor | Course |
| :--- | :--- |
| Prof. Kim | Data Structures |
| Prof. Lee | Algorithms |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fourth Normal Form (4NF) & 5Ô∏è‚É£ Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

4NF and 5NF are rarely encountered in practice, but it's good to know the concepts.

- **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**: Eliminates **multi-valued dependencies (MVD)**. This dependency arises in 1:N relationships.
- **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**: Deals with **join dependencies (JD)**. It requires that every join dependency is implied by the candidate keys.

---

## üîÑ Denormalization

**Denormalization** is the process of intentionally violating normalization rules by combining tables or allowing redundancy to **improve database performance**. It is used to avoid costly joins, but it must be applied cautiously as it can risk data inconsistency.

- **Common Techniques**: Table merging, table splitting (horizontal/vertical), adding redundant columns.
