> üí° Understanding the history of **web service interface methods** and the role of each technology is a key point for the Information Processing Engineer exam. This post compares the classic representative, **SOAP**, with the modern **REST** to clarify their differences.

## üèõÔ∏è Web Service Interfaces: Two Approaches

A web service is a way for different systems to interact over the internet. There are two main approaches to the interfaces for this interaction. One is the **classic stack (SOAP, WSDL, UDDI)**, which explicitly defines everything, and the other is the **modern style (REST)**, which follows the principles of the web.

Let's use the analogy of booking and ordering at a restaurant.

### 1. The Classic Web Service Trio: SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI

In the early 2000s, enterprises used these three technologies as a set for stable and standardized system integration. Their goal was to **"find out where a service is (UDDI), check its user manual (WSDL), and then communicate according to the defined rules (SOAP)."**

#### UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration)

- **Role**: A **'phone book' or 'restaurant guide'** for web services.
- **Description**: It acts as a **search engine** to find out which restaurant (service) is where and what kind of food it serves. It is rarely used today.

#### WSDL (Web Services Description Language)

- **Role**: A **'detailed menu' or 'user manual'** for a service.
- **Description**: This is the detailed menu of the restaurant found through UDDI. It describes in great detail, in **XML format**, what dishes (methods) are available, the price of each dish (parameters), and what information (data types) needs to be provided when ordering.

#### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

- **Role**: A **'formal order form'** following a set format.
- **Description**: After reviewing the WSDL menu, you place an order (request) in a very formal manner according to a set format. It uses a very strict **XML message**, like saying, "This order is written according to the SOAP specification..."

> **Summary**: The classic approach is like visiting a new city, finding a restaurant with a guidebook (UDDI), reading a thick menu (WSDL) thoroughly, and then submitting a formal order form (SOAP). The process is complex but very clear and reliable.

### 2. The Star of Modern Web APIs: REST

In reaction to the complexity of the SOAP approach, the simpler and more web-friendly **REST (Representational State Transfer)** style emerged and has become the mainstream for web APIs today.

- **Role**: A **'design philosophy'** that makes the most of the web's basic principles (HTTP).
- **Description**:
  - No separate guidebook (UDDI) is needed. It is assumed that you already know the restaurant's address (**URI**). (e.g., `https://example.com/dishes/pasta`)
  - No thick menu (WSDL) is needed either. You communicate with **simple, universally understood actions (HTTP methods)**, such as saying, "Show me the menu (`GET`)" or "I'll order this (`POST`)."
  - Instead of a complex order form (SOAP), you make a request by writing it down on a simple **memo (usually JSON)**.

> **Summary**: The REST approach is like going to a regular restaurant and ordering comfortably with just a few words. It is much faster, more flexible, and easier to learn.

### üìä SOAP-based Approach vs. REST Style Comparison

| Category          | **SOAP, WSDL, UDDI Stack**                              | **REST Style**                                     |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concept**       | **Protocol**: Strict rules                              | **Architectural Style**: Flexible principles       |
| **Data Format**   | **XML only**                                            | **JSON**, XML, etc., used freely (mostly JSON)     |
| **Communication** | Can use other protocols besides HTTP                    | **Works only over HTTP** (maximizes HTTP features) |
| **Complexity**    | High (requires WSDL, schema, etc.)                      | **Low** (only need to know HTTP and URI)           |
| **Performance**   | Relatively slow and heavy                               | **Fast and lightweight**                           |
| **Primary Use**   | Enterprise systems requiring high security/transactions | Most public APIs, mobile apps, web services        |
