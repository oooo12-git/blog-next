## 📝 Overall Review of the 2025 2nd Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam

The main features of the 2nd round of the 2025 practical exam are as follows:

- **😀 Decreased difficulty in programming questions**: Considering the low pass rate (15%) of the 1st round, the overall difficulty of programming questions seems to have been adjusted.
- **👏 Decreased difficulty in theory questions**: Due to the low pass rate in the 1st round, many theory questions were based on past exam questions.
- **❗️ No SQL query questions**: The most significant feature is that SQL query questions, which many candidates expected, did not appear.
- **📉 Disappearance of C/Java `for` loops**: Instead of complex `for` loops that could easily lead to mistakes, the exam featured relatively simple `while` loops. This seems to indicate an intention to assess fundamental programming knowledge.
- **🔥 Disappearance of 'easy' programming questions**: Programming questions with a 'low' difficulty level, which were easy to score, have disappeared. This suggests the examiners' intention to raise the overall difficulty level of the questions.

## 📋 Review of 2025 2nd Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Theory Questions

- With no SQL query questions, there were fewer DB problems than expected.
- Many questions were from the Network/OS subjects. **There were numerous questions on memory management and process scheduling.**
- Compared to the 1st round of 2025, many questions were from past exams. **Since questions were mainly from past exams**, it might have felt easy for those who solved many of them.
- ❗️ As the pass rate is expected to rise, the difficulty of theory questions for the 3rd round of 2025 is likely to be adjusted upwards.

## 📋 Review of 2025 2nd Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Programming Questions

- **There are no more 'easy' level questions.** This reveals the examiners' intention to raise the overall difficulty of programming questions.
- **It seems unnecessary to solve many 'easy' level problems from previous past exams.**
- 'for loop' questions in C and Java have disappeared. 'for loop' questions could be solved with good concentration. It seems more questions that test programming knowledge rather than concentration will be asked in the future.

As the difficulty of both programming and theory questions has decreased, the pass rate is expected to be around 20-25%.

### 👺 2025 3rd Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Theory Question Prediction

> A more accurate prediction will be possible once the exact pass rate is released. Considering the current estimated pass rate, the difficulty of the 3rd round of the 2025 practical exam theory questions is expected to be adjusted upwards.

- **It is expected that many new types of questions, not from past exams, will be asked.** In the 2nd round of 2025, there were 3 new types of questions. For the 3rd round of 2025, we predict more, around 5 to 6.
- The Network/OS subject, which had many questions in the 2nd round, is expected to have a smaller share with 1 to 2 questions in the 3rd round.
- It is expected that SQL statements will be included in the 3rd round. Including SQL statements, the DB subject is expected to have 3 to 4 questions.
- The Security/New Technology subject is expected to have 1 to 2 questions.
- The SW Design subject, which had 1 question in the 2nd round, is expected to have 2 to 3 questions in the 3rd round.
- The SW Development subject is expected to have 2 questions, the same as the 2nd round.
- It is expected that there will be 11 to 12 questions. The strategy should be to aim for 7 correct answers, same as the 2025 2nd round strategy.

## 💡 Additional Exam Information

### Do I really need to bring my Information Processing Engineer admission ticket?

In conclusion, **you don't necessarily need to bring it.** You only need to know your exam number, and if you forget it, you can ask the proctor to check it for you.

### Information Processing Engineer Exam Time and Entry Information

- **Official Exam Time**: 09:30 ~ 12:00
- **Entry Time**: Must be in the exam room by 09:00
- The admission ticket states that you should be in the room 30 minutes before the exam starts. However, they do not check for entry at 08:30, so it's fine to arrive by 09:00.

### 2025 2nd Information Processing Engineer Practical Exam Results Announcement Date

- The results for the 2nd 2025 Information Processing Engineer practical exam are scheduled to be announced on September 12, 2025, at 9:00 AM. You can check on the [Q-Net homepage](https://www.q-net.or.kr/anc001.do?id=anc001011&gSite=Q&gId=).
