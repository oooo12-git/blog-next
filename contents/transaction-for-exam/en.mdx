## Transaction Properties: ACID

To ensure the integrity and consistency of a database, a transaction must satisfy the following four main properties (ACID).

| Property                 | Description                                                                                  |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atomicity**            | All operations of a transaction must be executed successfully, or none of them should be (All or Nothing). |
| **Consistency**          | The database must always remain in a consistent state after a transaction is executed.       |
| **Isolation**            | No other transaction can interfere while one transaction is being executed.                  |
| **Durability**           | The results of a successfully completed transaction must be permanently stored in the database. |

## Database Recovery Techniques

These are techniques for restoring data to a previous consistent state when a database failure occurs.

### Core Components of Recovery Techniques

| Component         | Description                                                                                                |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **REDO**          | If a transaction has successfully committed but its changes have not been written to disk, REDO applies those changes again. |
| **UNDO**          | If a transaction fails, UNDO reverts the database to its original state before the changes were made.        |

### Types of Recovery Techniques

| Technique                           | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Log-based Recovery**              | Changes to the database are sequentially recorded in a log file. In case of failure, this log is used for recovery.                         |
| &nbsp;&nbsp; - Deferred Update      | Delays applying changes to the database until the transaction successfully completes. It only requires REDO, not UNDO.                       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp; - Immediate Update     | Changes made during a transaction are immediately reflected in the database. Both REDO and UNDO may be necessary.                            |
| **Checkpoint Recovery**             | Saves a consistent state of the database at a specific point in time (a checkpoint). If a failure occurs, recovery starts from the most recent checkpoint, reducing recovery time. |
| **Shadow Paging**                   | Creates a copy (shadow page) of the page that needs to be modified. When the transaction completes successfully, the original page is replaced with the shadow page. |
