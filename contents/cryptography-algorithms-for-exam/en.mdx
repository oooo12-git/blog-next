### 1. Symmetric-Key Encryption Algorithms üîë

Symmetric-key encryption uses the **same key for both encryption and decryption**. Key management is crucial since there is only one key, but it has the advantage of fast encryption speeds.

| **Developed by** | IBM (1975)                                                   | KISA (Korea Internet & Security Agency, 1999) | Joan Daemen, Vincent Rijmen (2001)                    |
| **Block Size**   | 64-bit                                                       | 128-bit                                       | 128-bit                                               |
| **Key Length**   | 56-bit (actually 64-bit)                                     | 128, 256-bit                                  | 128, 192, 256-bit                                     |
| **Structure**    | Feistel Structure                                            | Feistel Structure                             | SPN (Substitution-Permutation Network)                |
| **Security**     | **Vulnerable**. No longer recommended for use.               | Secure. Used as a domestic standard in Korea. | **Very secure**. Widely used as the current standard. |
| **Features**     | An early standard. Complemented by 3DES but replaced by AES. | South Korean standard encryption algorithm.   | The US standard that replaced DES. Most widely used.  |

**üí° Key Takeaways**:

- **DES**: The first standard, but now **vulnerable** due to its short key length.
- **AES**: The **most secure and widely used** symmetric-key algorithm today.
- **SEED**: A **South Korean** symmetric-key algorithm.

### 2. Asymmetric-Key (Public-Key) Encryption Algorithms üë•

Asymmetric-key encryption uses **separate keys for encryption and decryption**. One key is made public (public key), while the other is kept secret (private key). It is slower than symmetric-key encryption but has the significant advantage of allowing secure key exchange.

### 3. Hash Encryption Algorithms ‚õìÔ∏è

A hash algorithm is a one-way function that converts data of arbitrary length into a **fixed-length hash value**. It is irreversible and is mainly used for data integrity verification or password storage.

#### Key Algorithm Comparison

| Category         | MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5)            | SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)                       | SHA-2 (SHA-256/384/512)                                                        |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Developed by** | Ronald Rivest (1991)                        | NSA (1995)                                            | NSA (2001)                                                                     |
| **Hash Size**    | 128-bit                                     | 160-bit                                               | 256, 384, 512-bit                                                              |
| **Security**     | **Very vulnerable (collision found)**       | **Vulnerable (collision found)**                      | **Secure**                                                                     |
| **Features**     | Widely used in the past but now prohibited. | More secure than MD5, but its use is now discouraged. | The most widely used hash algorithm today. The number indicates the hash size. |

**üí° Key Takeaways**:

- **MD5, SHA-1**: **Collision vulnerabilities** have been found, so they should no longer be used.
- **SHA-2 family (SHA-256, etc.)**: The most **widely used** and secure hash algorithm, currently the security standard.
