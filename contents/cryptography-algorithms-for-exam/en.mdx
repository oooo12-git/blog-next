## Core Concepts of Encryption Algorithms for the Engineer Information Processing Exam

Hello, fellow candidates for the Engineer Information Processing certification! In this post, we will provide a complete summary of **encryption algorithms**, a topic frequently covered in the practical exam. We will compare the main types and features of symmetric-key, asymmetric-key, and hash algorithms, and work through practice questions.

### 1. Symmetric-Key Encryption Algorithms üîë

Symmetric-key encryption uses the **same key for both encryption and decryption**. Key management is crucial since there is only one key, but it has the advantage of fast encryption speeds.

#### Key Algorithm Comparison

| Category | DES (Data Encryption Standard) | SEED | AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Developed by** | IBM (1975) | KISA (Korea Internet & Security Agency, 1999) | Joan Daemen, Vincent Rijmen (2001) |
| **Block Size** | 64-bit | 128-bit | 128-bit |
| **Key Length** | 56-bit (actually 64-bit) | 128, 256-bit | 128, 192, 256-bit |
| **Structure** | Feistel Structure | Feistel Structure | SPN (Substitution-Permutation Network) |
| **Security** | **Vulnerable**. No longer recommended for use. | Secure. Used as a domestic standard in Korea. | **Very secure**. Widely used as the current standard. |
| **Features** | An early standard. Complemented by 3DES but replaced by AES. | South Korean standard encryption algorithm. | The US standard that replaced DES. Most widely used. |

**üí° Key Takeaways**:
- **DES**: The first standard, but now **vulnerable** due to its short key length.
- **AES**: The **most secure and widely used** symmetric-key algorithm today.
- **SEED**: A **South Korean** symmetric-key algorithm.

### 2. Asymmetric-Key (Public-Key) Encryption Algorithms üë•

Asymmetric-key encryption uses **separate keys for encryption and decryption**. One key is made public (public key), while the other is kept secret (private key). It is slower than symmetric-key encryption but has the significant advantage of allowing secure key exchange.

#### Key Algorithm Comparison

| Category | Diffie-Hellman | RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) | ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Use** | **Key Exchange** | **Encryption, Digital Signatures** | **Encryption, Digital Signatures** |
| **Underlying Principle** | Discrete Logarithm Problem | Difficulty of Integer Factorization | Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem |
| **Key Length** | Relatively long (e.g., 2048-bit) | Relatively long (e.g., 2048-bit) | **Relatively short** (e.g., 256-bit) |
| **Performance** | Moderate | Slow | **Fast** |
| **Security** | Secure | Secure | **Very secure (high security with a short key)** |
| **Features** | The first public-key algorithm. Used only for key exchange. | The most widely used public-key algorithm. | Provides the same level of security as RSA with a shorter key. Advantageous for IoT and mobile environments. |

**üí° Key Takeaways**:
- **Diffie-Hellman**: Cannot be used for encryption/decryption, only for **secure key exchange**.
- **RSA**: Based on the difficulty of **integer factorization** and is the most popular asymmetric-key algorithm.
- **ECC**: Offers high security with a **short key length**, resulting in excellent performance. Suitable for mobile environments.

### 3. Hash Encryption Algorithms ‚õìÔ∏è

A hash algorithm is a one-way function that converts data of arbitrary length into a **fixed-length hash value**. It is irreversible and is mainly used for data integrity verification or password storage.

#### Key Algorithm Comparison

| Category | MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) | SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) | SHA-2 (SHA-256/384/512) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Developed by** | Ronald Rivest (1991) | NSA (1995) | NSA (2001) |
| **Hash Size** | 128-bit | 160-bit | 256, 384, 512-bit |
| **Security** | **Very vulnerable (collision found)** | **Vulnerable (collision found)** | **Secure** |
| **Features** | Widely used in the past but now prohibited. | More secure than MD5, but its use is now discouraged. | The most widely used hash algorithm today. The number indicates the hash size. |

**üí° Key Takeaways**:
- **MD5, SHA-1**: **Collision vulnerabilities** have been found, so they should no longer be used.
- **SHA-2 family (SHA-256, etc.)**: The most **widely used** and secure hash algorithm, currently the security standard.
