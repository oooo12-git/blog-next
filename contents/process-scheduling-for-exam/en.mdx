## üö¶ Why Do We Need Process Scheduling?

A computer needs to handle multiple processes simultaneously. The rule that decides which process gets assigned the CPU is called **process scheduling**. The goal of scheduling is to use the CPU efficiently, give fair opportunities to all processes, and minimize user waiting time.

Scheduling methods are broadly divided into two types: **Non-preemptive** and **Preemptive**.

- **Non-preemptive Scheduling**: Once a process is allocated the CPU, no other process can take it away until the process finishes or voluntarily releases the CPU for an I/O operation.
- **Preemptive Scheduling**: The operating system can forcibly interrupt the currently running process and allocate the CPU to another process if deemed necessary. This is suitable for time-sharing systems.

> üí° Try calculating the **average waiting time** and **average turnaround time** yourself using the example problems provided with each algorithm description below!

## üö´ Non-preemptive Scheduling

Once allocated, no one can stop it until it's done.

### 1. FIFO (First-In, First-Out) or FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)

The simplest method, allocating the CPU in the order that processes arrive in the **Ready Queue**.

- **Pros**: Easy to implement and fair.
- **Cons**: If a long process arrives first, subsequent short processes have to wait indefinitely, causing the **Convoy Effect**.

### 2. SJF (Shortest Job First)

Allocates the CPU to the process with the **shortest execution time**.

- **Pros**: The optimal algorithm for minimizing average waiting time.
- **Cons**: Long processes can be indefinitely postponed by new short processes, leading to **Starvation**. It's also difficult to predict the exact execution time of each process in advance.

### 3. HRN (Highest Response-ratio Next)

Developed to compensate for the starvation problem of SJF. It dynamically determines priority by considering both **waiting time and execution time**.

- **Priority Calculation**: `(Waiting Time + Burst Time) / Burst Time`
- **Characteristic**: The CPU is allocated to the process with the highest value. As waiting time increases, so does the priority, thus preventing starvation.

### 4. Deadline

Used in real-time systems where a process must be completed within a given **deadline**. Processes with the nearest deadline are given higher priority.

### 5. Priority

The CPU is allocated based on a **static priority** assigned to each process. The process with the highest priority runs first. Like SJF, it can cause starvation.

## üîÑ Preemptive Scheduling

A flexible approach that can stop a running process at any time to hand the CPU over to another process.

### 1. SRT (Shortest Remaining Time)

A preemptive version of the SJF algorithm. If a new process arrives with a shorter execution time than the **remaining time of the current process**, the CPU is immediately taken away and given to the new process.

- **Pros**: Can further reduce average waiting time.
- **Cons**: Frequent context switching can cause overhead, and starvation can still occur.

### 2. Round Robin (RR)

An approach that adds a time quantum (or time slice) to FIFO. Each process uses the CPU for a **fixed amount of time**, and if the time is up, it moves to the back of the ready queue.

- **Pros**: Suitable for interactive systems as all processes are guaranteed fair CPU time.
- **Cons**: If the time quantum is too large, it becomes like FIFO. If it's too small, context switching becomes too frequent, increasing overhead. Setting an appropriate time quantum is crucial.

## üìù Practice Problems

<ProblemAnswer
  problem="When the following processes arrive at the ready queue in order, calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time using SJF (Non-preemptive) scheduling.

| Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| P1 | 0 | 6 |
| P2 | 1 | 3 |
| P3 | 2 | 4 |
| P4 | 3 | 2 |
"
  correctAnswer="Average Waiting Time: 4.75, Average Turnaround Time: 8.5"
/>

### Solution (SJF)

1.  **Determine Execution Order**:
    -   Time 0: P1 arrives. Executes (Burst time 6).
    -   Since it's non-preemptive, P1 runs to completion (Finish time 6).
    -   At time 6: P2, P3, P4 have all arrived. Compare their burst times (P2:3, P3:4, P4:2).
    -   P4 executes (Burst time 2, Finish time 8).
    -   P2 executes (Burst time 3, Finish time 11).
    -   P3 executes (Burst time 4, Finish time 15).
    -   **Execution Order: P1 -> P4 -> P2 -> P3**

2.  **Calculate Waiting/Turnaround Time**:
    -   **Turnaround Time** = Finish Time - Arrival Time
    -   **Waiting Time** = Turnaround Time - Burst Time

| Process | Arrival | Burst | Finish | Turnaround | Waiting |
| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: |
| P1 | 0 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| P2 | 1 | 3 | 11 | 10 | 7 |
| P3 | 2 | 4 | 15 | 13 | 9 |
| P4 | 3 | 2 | 8 | 5 | 3 |
| **Total** | | | | **34** | **19** |

3.  **Calculate Average**:
    -   **Average Waiting Time**: 19 / 4 = **4.75**
    -   **Average Turnaround Time**: 34 / 4 = **8.5**

<ProblemAnswer
  problem="Under the same conditions, calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time using SRT (Preemptive) scheduling."
  correctAnswer="Average Waiting Time: 3.5, Average Turnaround Time: 7.25"
/>

### Solution (SRT)

1.  **Determine Execution Order (Timeline)**:
    -   0: P1 arrives. P1 runs (Remaining time 6).
    -   1: P2 arrives (Burst 3). Shorter than P1's remaining time (5), so preempt P1. P2 runs.
    -   2: P3 arrives (Burst 4). Longer than P2's remaining time (2), so P2 continues.
    -   3: P4 arrives (Burst 2). Longer than P2's remaining time (1), so P2 continues.
    -   4: P2 finishes. Remaining processes: P1(5), P3(4), P4(2). P4 runs.
    -   6: P4 finishes. Remaining processes: P1(5), P3(4). P3 runs.
    -   10: P3 finishes. Remaining process: P1(5). P1 runs.
    -   15: P1 finishes.
    -   **Execution Trace: P1(1) -> P2(3) -> P4(2) -> P3(4) -> P1(5)**

2.  **Calculate Waiting/Turnaround Time**:
    -   P1: Finish 15, Arrival 0, Burst 6 -> Turnaround 15, Waiting 9
    -   P2: Finish 4, Arrival 1, Burst 3 -> Turnaround 3, Waiting 0
    -   P3: Finish 10, Arrival 2, Burst 4 -> Turnaround 8, Waiting 4
    -   P4: Finish 6, Arrival 3, Burst 2 -> Turnaround 3, Waiting 1
    
| Process | Arrival | Burst | Finish | Turnaround | Waiting |
| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: |
| P1 | 0 | 6 | 15 | 15 | 9 |
| P2 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 0 |
| P3 | 2 | 4 | 10 | 8 | 4 |
| P4 | 3 | 2 | 6 | 3 | 1 |
| **Total** | | | | **29** | **14** |

3.  **Calculate Average**:
    -   **Average Waiting Time**: 14 / 4 = **3.5**
    -   **Average Turnaround Time**: 29 / 4 = **7.25**

<ProblemAnswer
  problem="Under the same conditions, calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time using Round Robin (RR, Time Quantum=2) scheduling."
  correctAnswer="Average Waiting Time: 5.5, Average Turnaround Time: 9.25"
/>

### Solution (Round Robin, Quantum=2)

1.  **Determine Execution Order (Queue Changes)**:
    -   0: [P1] -> P1 runs (2)
    -   2: [P2, P3, P1] -> P2 runs (2)
    -   4: [P4, P1, P2] -> P4 runs (2) -> P4 finishes
    -   6: [P1, P2, P3] -> P1 runs (2)
    -   8: [P2, P3, P1] -> P2 runs (1) -> P2 finishes
    -   9: [P3, P1] -> P3 runs (2)
    -   11: [P1, P3] -> P1 runs (2) -> P1 finishes
    -   13: [P3] -> P3 runs (2) -> P3 finishes
    -   **Finish Order: P4(6) -> P2(9) -> P1(13) -> P3(15)**

2.  **Calculate Waiting/Turnaround Time**:

| Process | Arrival | Burst | Finish | Turnaround | Waiting |
| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: | :---: |
| P1 | 0 | 6 | 13 | 13 | 7 |
| P2 | 1 | 3 | 9 | 8 | 5 |
| P3 | 2 | 4 | 15 | 13 | 9 |
| P4 | 3 | 2 | 6 | 3 | 1 |
| **Total** | | | | **37** | **22** |

3.  **Calculate Average**:
    -   **Average Waiting Time**: 22 / 4 = **5.5**
    -   **Average Turnaround Time**: 37 / 4 = **9.25**
