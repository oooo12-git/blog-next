## Why were 'IaaS, PaaS, SaaS' on the Information Processing Engineer Exam?

Amidst the flood of cloud technologies, the reason the most basic 'IaaS, PaaS, SaaS' models were on the exam is that these three models are the **core classification system that forms the basis of all cloud services**.

- **Understanding the Service Essence**: They are the most fundamental agreement defining what users can do on the cloud and to what extent they are responsible for management.
- **Foundation of Modern Technology**: All new technologies like Serverless (an extension of PaaS), Kubernetes (running on IaaS), and Multi-Cloud (a combination of various IaaS/PaaS) ultimately operate on or extend these three models.

In conclusion, the examiner wanted to assess whether the candidates understood the **most fundamental principles and service models supporting the cloud ecosystem**, beyond just knowing the names of the latest technologies.

## üí° 3 Fundamental Principles Leading the Cloud Era

If IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS classify the 'types' of services, there are core 'operating principles' that drive the current cloud technology paradigm. These technologies are important in their own right for the exam, but they also form the basis for understanding other new technologies.

> ‚≠êÔ∏è : Concept that appeared on the written exam

| Technology                   | Core Principle                                                                      | What this technology is the basis for                                  |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **üî•Hypervisor & ‚≠êÔ∏èDocker** | **Virtualization**: Logically partitioning and isolating physical resources         | Everything in cloud computing, Efficient server resource utilization   |
| **üî•Kubernetes**             | **Orchestration**: Automatically managing/coordinating numerous containers          | Microservices Architecture (MSA), Large-scale application deployment   |
| **Serverless Computing**     | **Abstraction**: Completely hiding infrastructure to focus solely on code execution | Event-driven architecture, Fast development & scaling, Cost efficiency |

### 1. üî•Virtualization (Hypervisor & ‚≠êÔ∏èDocker)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="'Isolation' allows multiple operating systems or applications to run simultaneously on a single physical system.">
  - **Concept**:
    - **Hypervisor**: Virtualizes **hardware** to create multiple **Virtual Machines (VMs)**. Each VM has its own independent operating system (Guest OS). (Heavyweight virtualization)
    - **Docker (Container)**: Virtualizes the **operating system (OS)** to create multiple **containers**. All containers share the host OS's kernel. (Lightweight virtualization)
  - **Why it's fundamental**: Cloud computing could not exist without 'virtualization'. It is the core principle of the cloud, allowing the resources of a single physical server to be divided and provided to dozens or hundreds of users simultaneously.

</Details>

### 2. üî•Kubernetes (Container Orchestration)

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="Acts as a 'helmsman' (Kubernetes) that automatically manages hundreds or thousands of 'containers' (ships).">
  - **Concept**: As container technologies like Docker became widespread, the need arose to efficiently deploy, scale, and manage numerous containers. Kubernetes is the 'container management system' that automates this entire process.
  - **Why it's fundamental**: Modern large-scale applications (MSA) are composed of a combination of many small services (containers). Kubernetes is the de facto standard technology that directs and coordinates this complex system to operate reliably.
</Details>

### 3. üî•Serverless Computing

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="Allows developers to focus only on 'code' without worrying about servers, and pay only for what they use.">
  - **Concept**: It doesn't mean 'no servers', but rather that developers don't need to manage servers themselves. The cloud provider handles all server provisioning, scaling, and management. Developers only need to write a function that executes when a specific event occurs. (FaaS: Function as a Service)
  - **Why it's fundamental**: It demonstrates the ultimate goal of cloud technology: **'complete abstraction'**. It is a paradigm that maximizes productivity by minimizing concerns about infrastructure and allowing developers to focus solely on business logic.

## üì° Detailed Technology Explanations

### Cloud Expansion and Integration

#### Multi-Cloud

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="A strategy of using services from two or more different cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) together.">
  - **Features**: Avoids technical and cost dependency on a specific cloud company (prevents Vendor Lock-in) and allows for configuring a system by selectively using the advantages of each service. It is beneficial for Disaster Recovery (DR) and ensuring high availability.
  - **Current Adoption**: **Very High**. Many companies are adopting a multi-cloud strategy for cost optimization, risk distribution, and leveraging specific features.
</Details>

#### Inter-Cloud Computing

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="Technology to ensure interoperability between different cloud services.">
  - **Features**: Aims to make different clouds work together seamlessly as if they were a single cloud, through standardized APIs or protocols. It is a key element in configuring a hybrid cloud (private + public).
  - **Current Adoption**: **High**. It is a continuously evolving field for data transfer, workload migration, and service linkage between clouds.
</Details>

#### Meta Cloud

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="A higher-level cloud that manages and operates multiple cloud services through a single, unified interface (portal).">
  - **Features**: Its main purpose is to reduce the complexity of a multi-cloud environment. Users can view and control resources across multiple clouds at a glance through the meta cloud portal.
  - **Current Adoption**: **Medium (Growing)**. As multi-cloud adoption increases, the need for integrated management has emerged, leading to the appearance of related solutions.
</Details>

### üíª Virtualization Technology

#### üî•Hypervisor

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="Software, firmware, or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). Also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM).">
  - **Types**:
    - **Type 1 (Native/Bare-metal)**: Installed and runs directly on the hardware. (e.g., VMware ESXi, Xen, KVM). Offers high performance and is mainly used in enterprise environments.
    - **Type 2 (Hosted)**: Installed and runs like an application on a conventional operating system (Windows, macOS). (e.g., VMware Workstation, VirtualBox). Mainly used for development and testing purposes.
  - **Current Adoption**: **Very High**. It is the foundational technology for all IaaS clouds and the core of server virtualization.
</Details>

#### ‚≠êÔ∏èDocker

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="An open-source container-based virtualization platform that allows for rapid building, testing, and deployment of applications.">
  - **Features**: Packages an application and everything it needs to run (libraries, dependencies, etc.) into a unit called an 'image'. This image allows the application to run consistently in an isolated state in any environment. It is lighter and faster than a VM.
  - **Current Adoption**: **Very High**. It has become the standard for modern application development and deployment.
</Details>

### üåê Others

#### N-Screen

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Details summary="A service that allows users to continuously enjoy a single piece of media content (like a movie or show) across various devices such as smartphones, TVs, PCs, and tablets.">
  - **Features**: The core idea is to store user information and content consumption history in the cloud, enabling users to resume content from the same point regardless of the device they access it from.
  - **Current Adoption**: **Very High**. Most OTT services like Netflix and YouTube support N-Screen by default.
</Details>
