Recently visited Donghae Squid Bossam Anyang branch, which became a hot topic after Pungja's "Ttoganjip" broadcast. I'll share an honest review from waiting to taste.

## How Long is the Wait?

**As of June 29, 2025** (right after Pungja's Ttoganjip broadcast), expect 1 to 1.5 hours of waiting.

Actual waiting experience:

- **Sunday 4 PM**: 30 people waiting, about 20-30 teams entering per hour
- **Sunday 5 PM**: 35 people waiting, entered exactly 1 hour after reservation

While this might be a temporary phenomenon due to the broadcast effect, it's advisable to visit with plenty of time for the time being.

## Spice Level - Warning for Spice-Sensitive People

**If you can't handle spice, prepare for a runny nose.** Don't be fooled by the name "bossam" and expect the mild spice level of regular bossam kimchi.

/>

As someone who usually avoids spicy food, the spice level was quite intense. The unique savory squid aroma pairs fantastically with the spicy sauce, but the more you eat, the more your entire mouth burns and your throat feels hot.

### Precautions for Spice-Sensitive People

1. **Protect your stomach beforehand**: Drink something like milk before eating
2. **Locate the restroom**: Essential if you have a stomach sensitive to spicy food
3. **Prepare for unwanted digestive consequences**

## How to Eat Deliciously

### Always Eat Squid with Radish Salad

The dish is called "squid bossam" probably because you eat it with radish like traditional bossam.

Initially, I wondered why radish salad was there, but after eating, I realized the chewy texture of squid and the crunchiness of radish salad make a perfect combination. It's the owner's stroke of genius.

### Beer Pairing is Essential

Eating with beer elevates the food quality to another level. However, they don't sell Cass beer - only **Terra is available**, so Cass fans should take note.

## Honest Taste Review of Donghae Squid Bossam Anyang Branch

**It's a delicious spice that relieves stress.** I properly relieved stress with spicy food after a long time.

As you continue eating, your tongue somewhat adapts to the spiciness, and you can taste the savory squid aroma again. That's when the real taste heaven begins.

### Must-Order Items

**Rice is essential.** They serve it in a metal bowl with sesame oil, which you can eat like bibimbap. One serving is enough for two people.

All the side dishes except squid bossam serve to neutralize the spiciness. Especially **eating wrapped with pickled radish** doubles the crunchiness and neutralizes the spice, perfect for spice-sensitive people.

## Overall Assessment of Donghae Squid Bossam Anyang Branch (Rating)

**Rating: 2.5/5 stars**

Despite the long wait due to the broadcast effect, it's a restaurant worth waiting for spicy food lovers. If you're spice-sensitive, you can try it with adequate preparation and readiness, but I wouldn't recommend it. The rating is a bit harsh because I'm spice-sensitive.
