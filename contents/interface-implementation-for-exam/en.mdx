> 💡 **Interface implementation** is the process of connecting an application's core functions with external systems and exchanging data. The Engineer Information Processing Practical Exam frequently asks questions that check your understanding of the features and differences of various interface technologies.

## 📚 Core Topics in Interface Implementation

Interface implementation requires an understanding of **how to communicate (communication technology)**, **in what format to exchange data (data representation format)**, **with what conventions to configure services (web service interface)**, and **how to communicate securely (security)**. You can study each topic in depth through the articles below.

### 1. 🔄 Interface Communication Technologies

This is how clients and servers exchange data. There are various technologies, from asynchronous communication and real-time communication to efficient data request methods.

### 2. 📄 Data Representation Formats

These are standard formats used when exchanging data between systems. JSON, XML, and YAML are used depending on readability and purpose.

### 3. 🏛️ Web Service Interfaces

These are protocols and architectural styles for providing and using services on a network. SOAP and REST are representative examples.

### 4. 🌉 Interface Security

These are encryption protocols for securely exchanging data. It is important to understand the layer where each protocol operates and its characteristics.
