> Security issues have recently become a major social concern.
>
> - With the constant stream of personal data breaches and the rise of AI-powered voice cloning, interest in security problems is growing.
> - Rather than focusing on the latest security attacks, exams tend to ask about the most fundamental and basic types of attacks.
> - This post covers **Network Attacks** and **DoS Attacks**, which have a high probability of appearing on exams.
> - It is recommended to focus on studying basic attack types that have not yet appeared on exams, rather than those that have already been tested.

## Network Attack vs. DoS Attack Differences

| Category          | Network Attack                                     | DoS Attack                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective**     | System intrusion, info theft, privilege escalation | Service disruption, system paralysis         |
| **Attack Method** | Infiltration via network vulnerabilities           | Resource exhaustion via massive traffic      |
| **Key Feature**   | Stealthy, persistent access                        | Overt, temporary impact                      |
| **Damage Type**   | Data leakage, system manipulation                  | Service unavailability, reduced availability |

### Key Differences

- **Network Attack**: "Break in and take" - Infiltrating a system to steal or manipulate information.
- **DoS Attack**: "Block the door" - Preventing legitimate users from accessing a service, making the system unusable.
