> Recently, security issues have become major social problems.
>
> - Personal information leakage incidents continue to occur, and as AI-powered vibe coding becomes commonplace, interest in security issues is increasing.
> - Accordingly, security issues are likely to be prominently featured in Information Processing Engineer practical exam questions.
> - While there are various types of security attacks, we have organized only network attacks and DOS attacks, which are judged to have a high probability of being tested.
> - For other security attack-related terms, we recommend referring to the Sujebi practical exam basic textbook.

## Network Attacks vs DOS Attacks Comparison

| Category                    | Network Attacks                                           | DOS Attacks                                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**                 | System intrusion, information theft, privilege escalation | Service disruption, system paralysis             |
| **Attack Method**           | Exploiting network vulnerabilities for penetration        | Resource exhaustion through massive traffic      |
| **Key Characteristics**     | Stealthy execution, persistent access                     | Explicit, temporary impact                       |
| **Damage Type**             | Data breach, system manipulation                          | Service unavailability, availability degradation |
| **Representative Examples** | Sniffing, Spoofing, Session Hijacking                     | SYN Flooding, DDoS, Ping of Death                |

### Key Differences

- **Network Attacks**: "Break in and steal" - Infiltrate systems to steal or manipulate information
- **DOS Attacks**: "Block the door" - Prevent normal service usage by making systems unavailable
