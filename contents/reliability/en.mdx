## What is Reliability?

Reliability is a concept developed from classical test theory in the field of education.  
According to classical test theory, the measured value we obtain through measurement consists of the following:

$Measured\ Value\ X = True\ Value\ T + Random\ Error\ \\epsilon$

**The reason we perform measurements is ultimately to find out the true value.**

Therefore, we hope that the measured value contains much more of the true value than random error.

Reliability is used to **judge the usefulness of measurement** in this regard.

Reliability $\\rho = \\frac{Var(T)}{Var(X)}$

By measuring the ratio of true value variance to total measured value variance, it **tells us how much true value is contained in the measured value.**

**High reliability is connected to consistency in measurement.**

High reliability means that the ratio of true value in the measured value is high, which means **the ratio of random error is small**.

If random error is small, the variation in measured values will not be large even if measurements are taken multiple times. In other words, we can say that consistency is high.

## **Measuring Reliability**

To measure reliability according to the definition mentioned above, we need to know the variance of the true value.

However, in most cases, the true value is unknown. Often, the purpose of the experiment itself is to estimate the true value.

Therefore, **measuring reliability using the definition is nearly impossible.**

For this reason, a different method is used to measure reliability.

This method involves **finding the reliability of two parallel measurements.**

### **Parallel**

Being parallel means that two measurements (X1, X2) satisfy the following conditions:

1.  The true values are the same (T1 = T2)
2.  The errors of the two measurements are independent ($Cov(\\epsilon1,\\epsilon2)=0$)
3.  The variances of the errors of the two measurements are the same ($Var(\\epsilon1) = Var(\\epsilon2)$)

---

**In this case, the correlation coefficient of the two parallel measurements equals the reliability of both measurements.**

$Corr(X1,X2) = \\rho(X1,X2) = \\rho$

The assumption of being parallel is important in reliability testing because it allows us to calculate reliability simply through correlation coefficients.
