Zebra Restaurant located in Anyang Daengri-dan-gil is a popular Anyang restaurant known for its unique menu. Here's an honest review of their Sun Pasta and Eggplant Rice Bowl.

## Anyang Daengri-dan-gil Zebra Restaurant Waiting Time Tips (Weekend Lunch)

The restaurant opens at 11:30 AM, but when can you start waiting?

I arrived at 10 AM and was able to add my name to the waiting list.

The kitchen was already preparing for opening, and despite it being 10 AM, there was already one reservation team ahead of me.

I'm not sure exactly when they start taking the waiting list, but **the tip is to go early if you can, add your name to the waiting list, and then come back right at 11:30 AM**.

They take orders in the order of the waiting list. So it's good to think about your order in advance.

The faster you order, the less time you'll wait for your food.

Side dishes came out in 5 minutes, but the Sun Pasta took 15 minutes (based on being 2nd on the waiting list).

The Eggplant Rice Bowl seemed to take about 20 minutes. Those with higher numbers on the waiting list might wait longer for their food.

The side dishes were mild and clean in taste. They had a homestyle feel that made me feel good.

## Zebra Restaurant Sun Pasta

It's spicy but somehow tastes like cookies. Personally, I think it tastes like less sweet White Heim.

This means the cream is very rich.

It's sprinkled with red pepper flakes, making it spicy, so it's not boring at all. It's an interesting flavor.

Flying fish roe is generously included.

I think the sweetness of the flying fish roe mixed with the cream is what created that cookie-like taste.

Since the Eggplant Rice Bowl is very clean in flavor, it contrasts nicely with the interesting taste of the Sun Pasta.

## Zebra Restaurant Eggplant Rice Bowl

The Eggplant Rice Bowl highlights the salty and savory meat flavor.

I don't know how they stir-fried the finely minced meat, but it's cleanly salty and savory.

This appears to be stuffed into the eggplant.

The eggplant texture is also excellent.

It's soft but has a pleasant, appropriate texture that's not unpleasant.

It seems to be cooked just right.

## Anyang Daengri-dan-gil Zebra Restaurant Overall Review (Rating)

**Rating: 4.0/5 stars**

If I come back to eat again, I'd like to try the sukiyaki. I think sukiyaki paired with the Eggplant Rice Bowl would be an excellent combination. However, I think I'll keep thinking about the interesting taste of the Sun Pasta.

If you're looking for unique menu items in Anyang Daengri-dan-gil, I recommend Zebra Restaurant.

## Zebra Restaurant Clothing Tips (Summer)

The interior is slightly cool but not extremely cold among restaurants. If you're sensitive to air conditioning, I'd recommend a light jacket, but most people probably won't need it.

## Zebra Restaurant Turnover Rate (Weekend Lunch)

If you arrive at 11:30 AM and can't get in with the first group, you should expect to wait about 30 minutes. The food service speed is not particularly fast.
