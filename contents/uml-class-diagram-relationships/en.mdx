The six relationships in UML class diagrams are crucial for understanding software design, but their similar terms can be confusing at first. Grouping similar concepts together and summarizing them in a table helps you grasp and memorize them at a glance.

## UML Class Diagram Relationships Summary Table

There are 6 relationships in total, consisting of 2 strong/weak has-a relationships (Composition/Aggregation), 2 strong/weak uses-a relationships (Association/Dependency), and 2 strong/weak is-a/can-do relationships (Generalization/Realization).

| Relationship       | Core Concept            | Diagram             | Keywords                                 | Simple Example                                                                                                              |
| :----------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Composition**    | Strong has-a            | Filled Diamond      | **Shared Lifecycle**, Essential Part     | `House` and `Room` (If the house is destroyed, the room is also destroyed.)                                                 |
| **Aggregation**    | Weak has-a              | Empty Diamond       | **Independent Lifecycle**, Optional Part | `Department` and `Student` (Even if the department is closed, the student still exists.)                                    |
| **Association**    | Strong uses-a           | Solid Arrow         | Member Variable, Lasting Relationship    | `Soccer Team` and `Striker` (The soccer team **always** uses the striker.)                                                  |
| **Dependency**     | Weak uses-a             | Dashed Arrow        | **Parameter**, Brief Use                 | `Developer` and `Book` (The developer uses the book **briefly**.)                                                           |

## Class Diagrams for Each Relationship

### Composition

- **Keywords**: **Shared Lifecycle**, Essential Part
- **Example**: House and Room (If the house is destroyed, the room is also destroyed.)

<MermaidDiagram
  chart={`classDiagram
    direction LR

    class House["House"]
    class Room["Room"]
    House *--> Room : Composition

`}
/>

### Aggregation

- **Keywords**: **Independent Lifecycle**, Optional Part
- **Example**: Department and Student (Even if the department is closed, the student still exists.)

<MermaidDiagram
  chart={`classDiagram
    direction LR

    class Department["Department"]
    class Student["Student"]
    Department o--> Student : Aggregation

`}
/>

### Association

- **Keywords**: Member Variable, Lasting Relationship
- **Example**: Soccer Team and Striker (The soccer team always uses the striker.)

<MermaidDiagram
  chart={`classDiagram
    direction LR

    class Student["Student"]
    class Professor["Professor"]
    Student --> Professor : Association

`}
/>

### Dependency

- **Keywords**: Method Parameter, Brief Use
- **Example**: Developer and Book (The developer uses the book briefly.)

<MermaidDiagram
  chart={`classDiagram
    direction LR

    class Developer["Developer"]
    class Book["Book"]
    Developer ..> Book : Dependency

`}
/>

### Generalization

- **Keywords**: Inheritance, Parent-Child
- **Example**: A Cat is an Animal. (Animal is more **general** than a cat. Divided into superclass (Animal) and subclass (Cat), Animal \<|-- Cat)

<MermaidDiagram
  chart={`classDiagram
    direction LR

    class Animal["Animal"]
    class Cat["Cat"]
    Animal <|-- Cat : Generalization

`}
/>

### Realization

- **Keywords**: Interface, Fulfilling a contract
- **Example**: A Robot can clean. (Grouped by the **'capability'** to clean. 'Cleanable' \<|.. 'Robot')

<MermaidDiagram
  chart={`classDiagram
    direction LR

    class Cleanable["Cleanable"] {
      <<interface>>
    }
    class Robot["Robot"]
    Cleanable <|.. Robot : Realization

`}
/>

## Exam Preparation Problems

<ProblemAnswer
  problem="Among UML relationships, which one represents a composition of several independent objects into one, is expressed by connecting an empty diamond from the part to the whole, and represents a relationship where one object contains another?"
  correctAnswer="Aggregation"
/>

<ProblemAnswer
  problem="Among UML relationships, which one is a permanent and strong relationship, expressed by connecting a filled diamond from the part to the whole? It is a special form of aggregation where a change in the whole object affects the part object."
  correctAnswer="Composition"
/>
