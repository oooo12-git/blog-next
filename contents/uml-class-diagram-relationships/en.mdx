The six relationships in UML class diagrams are crucial for understanding software design, but their similar terms can be confusing at first. Grouping similar concepts together and summarizing them in a table helps you grasp and memorize them at a glance.

### UML Class Diagram Relationships Summary Table

There are 6 relationships in total, consisting of 2 strong/weak has-a relationships (Composition/Aggregation), 2 strong/weak uses-a relationships (Association/Dependency), 1 is-a relationship, and 1 can-do relationship (Generalization/Realization).

| Relationship       | Core Concept            | Keywords                                           | Simple Example                                                                                                                                    |
| :----------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Composition**    | Strong has-a            | **Shared Lifecycle**, Essential Part (Composition) | `House` and `Room` (If the house disappears, the room also disappears.) House [filled diamond] -> Room                                            |
| **Aggregation**    | Weak has-a              | **Independent Lifecycle**, Optional Part           | `Department` and `Student` (Even if the department disappears, the student doesn't disappear.) Department(whole) [empty diamond] -> Student(part) |
| **Association**    | Strong uses-a           | Member Variable, Lasting Relationship              | `Soccer Team` and `Striker` (The soccer team always uses the striker.) Soccer Team -> Striker                                                     |
| **Dependency**     | Weak uses-a             | Method Parameter, Brief Use                        | `Developer` and `Book` (The developer uses the book briefly.) Developer --> Book                                                                  |
| **Generalization** | is-a (Inheritance)      | Inheritance, Parent-Child                          | `Cat` is an `Animal`. (Animal is more **general** than cat. Divided into superclass(animal) and subclass(cat), Animal \<- Cat)                    |
| **Realization**    | can-do (Implementation) | Interface, Fulfilling a contract                   | `Robot` can `clean`. (Grouped by **'capability'** to clean. 'Can clean' \<-- 'Person')                                                            |
