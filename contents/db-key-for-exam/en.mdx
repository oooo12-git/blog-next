> üí° **Database Keys** are a core concept in relational databases, used to uniquely identify rows (Tuples) in a table and define relationships between tables. They are frequently tested in the Information Processing Engineer exam, so it's crucial to clearly understand the characteristics and relationships of each key.

| Key Type | Characteristics | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Key** | Chosen from candidate keys, Not Null | The key selected from candidate keys to represent the table. |
| **Alternate Key** | Remaining candidate keys | Candidate keys that were not selected as the primary key. |
| **Candidate Key** | Uniqueness O, Minimality O | A minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple. |
| **Superkey** | Uniqueness O, Minimality X | An attribute or set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple. |
| **Foreign Key** | References another table's primary key | Defines relationships between tables and ensures referential integrity. |

## üéØ What is a Database Key?

A **Key** is an **attribute or a set of attributes** that serves as a unique identifier to find or sort tuples (rows) that meet a condition, distinguishing them from other tuples. Keys ensure data integrity and enable efficient data management.

## ‚ú® Key Characteristics

Not all keys always satisfy these two properties, but they are essential for defining a candidate key.

- **Uniqueness**: A key value must be able to **uniquely identify a single tuple**. For example, in a 'Student' table, the 'student_id' uniquely identifies each student, thus satisfying uniqueness.
- **Minimality**: It must be composed of the **minimum number of attributes** that satisfy uniqueness. This means if any attribute is removed from the key, it no longer satisfies uniqueness.

## üîë Types of Keys and Their Relationships

There are several types of keys in a database, which have an inclusive relationship with each other.

**A**lternate Key + **P**rimary Key = **C**andidate Key ‚äÇ **S**uperkey.

### 1. Primary Key (PK)

- **Definition**: **A single key selected from the candidate keys**. It represents the table.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Cannot have a NULL value.**
  - Cannot have duplicate values.
  - Only one primary key exists per table.
- **Selection Criteria**: A candidate key that is short, does not change frequently, and does not have NULL values is usually selected as the primary key.
- **Example**: Between the two candidate keys `{student_id}` and `{resident_registration_number}`, `student_id` is generally chosen as the primary key.

### 2. Alternate Key

- **Definition**: The **remaining candidate keys** that were not selected as the primary key.
- **Characteristics**: They retain the properties of a candidate key (uniqueness, minimality).
- **Example**: If `student_id` is chosen as the primary key, `resident_registration_number` becomes an alternate key.

### 3. Candidate Key

- **Definition**: A key composed of the **minimum attributes** required to **uniquely identify** each row in a table.
- **Characteristics**: Must satisfy both **uniqueness** and **minimality**.
- **Example**: In the 'Student' table example above:
  - `{student_id}`: Candidate key (Uniqueness O, Minimality O)
  - `{resident_registration_number}`: Candidate key (Uniqueness O, Minimality O)
  - `{student_id, name}`: Not a candidate key (Minimality X - uniqueness is satisfied by `student_id` alone).

### 4. Superkey

- **Definition**: An attribute or a set of attributes that can **uniquely identify** each row in a table.
- **Characteristics**: It satisfies **uniqueness**, but not necessarily **minimality**.
- **Example**: Assuming a 'Student' table has attributes `(student_id, resident_registration_number, name)`:
  - `{student_id}`: Superkey (Uniqueness O)
  - `{resident_registration_number}`: Superkey (Uniqueness O)
  - `{student_id, name}`: Superkey (Uniqueness O)
  - `{student_id, resident_registration_number}`: Superkey (Uniqueness O)

### 5. Foreign Key (FK)

- **Definition**: An attribute in one table that **references the primary key (PK)** of another table.
- **Purpose**: Used to establish a **Relationship** between tables and ensure **referential integrity**.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Can only contain values that exist in the referenced primary key or NULL values.
  - The foreign key must have the same domain as the primary key it references.
- **Example**: In an 'Enrollment' table, the `student_id` attribute is a foreign key that references the primary key `student_id` in the 'Student' table. This establishes a relationship showing which student is enrolled in which course.
