## üöÄ Data Link Layer at a Glance

The **Data Link Layer** is the second layer of the OSI 7-layer model, responsible for reliably transmitting data over a physical link. Its main functions are **Framing, Flow Control, and Error Control**.

- **Data Link Protocol**: A communication standard that manages data exchange between node-to-node.
- **Error Control**: A technique to detect and correct data errors that may occur during transmission.

| Category | Key Protocols & Technologies | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Link Protocols** | HDLC, PPP, Frame Relay, ATM | Bit-oriented, character-oriented, high-speed data transmission, etc. |
| **Error Control Methods** | Forward Error Correction (FEC), Backward Error Correction (BEC) | Detects errors and requests retransmission or corrects them autonomously. |

## 1. üîó Data Link Protocols

Data link protocols manage data transmission between two adjacent devices.

### 1.1. HDLC (High-level Data Link Control)

- A bit-oriented protocol that supports both point-to-point and multi-point links.
- **Frame Structure**: Consists of `Flag - Address - Control - Information - FCS - Flag`.
- **Features**:
  - High transmission efficiency and reliability.
  - Uses **Bit Stuffing** to ensure data transparency (inserts a `0` after five consecutive `1`s in the data).
  - Primarily used for synchronous transmission.

### 1.2. PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)

- A character-oriented protocol mainly used for communication over serial interfaces between two computers.
- **Features**:
  - Unlike HDLC, it is character-oriented and has a more flexible frame structure.
  - Performs error detection only, leaving error recovery to upper layers.
  - Supports various Network Control Protocols (NCPs) like IP address assignment and authentication (PAP, CHAP).
  - Primarily used for asynchronous transmission but also supports synchronous.

### 1.3. Frame Relay

- A high-speed data transmission protocol developed to improve upon the shortcomings of X.25.
- **Features**:
  - Increases transmission speed by simplifying error and flow control (discards frames with errors and lets upper layers handle it).
  - Uses a Virtual Circuit method to establish a logical connection.
  - Mainly used for WAN services connecting LANs.

### 1.4. ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)

- A high-speed switching technology that transmits data in small, fixed-size **cells** of 53 bytes (5-byte header, 48-byte payload).
- **Features**:
  - Can transmit various types of information like voice, video, and data over a single network.
  - Provides very high speeds as the fixed-length cells allow for hardware-based switching.
  - Used as the core technology for B-ISDN.

## 2. üîß Data Link Error Control

This refers to the methods for detecting and correcting errors that occur during transmission.

> **ü§î Why Add Redundant Bits?**
>
> If only the original data is sent, the receiver has no way to determine if the data was corrupted during transmission or arrived intact. **Redundant bits** provide the receiver with a basis to **determine if an error has occurred**.
>
> - In **Backward Error Correction (BEC)**, minimal information (like a 'fingerprint') is added to **detect** an error.
> - In **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**, enough information (like an 'answer key') is added to both **detect and correct** the error directly.
>
> Both methods use redundant bits, but they differ in their purpose and the amount of information they carry.



### 2.1. Forward Error Correction (FEC)

- A method where the receiver **autonomously detects and corrects** errors.
- **Features**:
  - Sends redundant bits required for error correction along with the data (e.g., Hamming code, CRC).
  - Suitable for real-time or one-way communication as it doesn't require a reverse channel for retransmission requests.
  - Can be complex to implement and may reduce transmission efficiency due to the extra bits.

### 2.2. Backward Error Correction (BEC)

- A method where the receiver requests the sender to **retransmit** data upon detecting an error. Also known as **ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest)**.
- BEC consists of an error detection mechanism and the ARQ protocol that requests retransmission for detected errors.

#### Error Detection Techniques
Redundant bits are added to the data for transmission to detect errors.

1.  **Parity Check**
    - The simplest method, where a single **parity bit** is added to a block of data to make the number of `1`s either even (even parity) or odd (odd parity).
    - **Limitation**: It cannot detect an even number of bit errors (e.g., if two bits flip from `0` to `1`, the parity remains even).

2.  **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**
    - A powerful method that uses polynomial codes to detect errors. The sender divides the data by a predetermined **Generator Polynomial** to calculate a remainder, which is appended to the data and transmitted.
    - The receiver divides the received data by the same generator polynomial. If the remainder is `0`, the data is considered error-free.
    - It is highly effective at detecting burst errors. The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) in HDLC uses CRC.

3.  **Block Sum Check**
    - The data block is divided into several rows of a fixed size. The sum (or XOR operation) of each column is calculated to create a **check block**, which is sent with the data.
    - The receiver performs the same calculation to detect errors.

#### ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) Protocols
This is the procedure for managing retransmissions when an error is detected.

- **Types**:
    1.  **Stop-and-Wait ARQ**: Sends one frame and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK/NAK) before sending the next.
    2.  **Go-Back-N ARQ**: Retransmits all frames starting from the one where the error occurred.
    3.  **Selective Repeat ARQ**: Retransmits only the specific frame where the error occurred.
