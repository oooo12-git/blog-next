# Gwanghwamun Mijin, 70-Year Traditional Cold Buckwheat Noodle Restaurant

I visited 'Mijin', a cold buckwheat noodle specialty restaurant with a long history in Gwanghwamun. This place, established in 1952, is famous for its consistently long waiting lines. Let me share my honest review after dining there.

## Cold Buckwheat Noodles: Korean-Style Broth with Traditional Flavors

Mijin's cold buckwheat noodles feature Korean-style broth that doesn't use Japanese tsuyu. From the moment they pour the broth from the kettle, you can feel the history of over 70 years.

### Perfect Balance of the Broth

The broth taste is truly exquisite. The sweetness is perfectly balanced - neither too sweet nor too bland. It also has a rich umami flavor that keeps you coming back for more.

When you add the typical toppings we associate with buckwheat noodle broth, it becomes perfect:

- Seaweed powder
- Grated radish
- Thinly sliced scallions

The combination of these ingredients creates a truly fantastic broth.

### Fresh Handmade Noodles

The noodles are made fresh in the restaurant's basement, and you can really taste the freshness. The glossy appearance of the noodles raises expectations from the first glance.

The texture of the noodles is also excellent. The feel in your mouth and the chewiness perfectly capture what you expect from buckwheat noodles. The authentic taste and chewiness of buckwheat are well expressed.

### Right Portion Size, Additional Orders Available

When you order one serving, it comes in two stacked plates. It might be slightly insufficient for two people, but personally, I think it's just the right amount. Eating a slightly smaller portion is the way to keep visiting a restaurant for a long time.

If you need more, you can order additional noodles. It's not on the menu, but it seems to be available.

## Bossam Set Meal: Ultimate Value for Money

I ordered the bossam set meal (12,000 won) because I was told it offers much better value than the bossam (tasting portion) (15,000 won).

### Perfect Composition

The bossam set meal includes:

- Just the right amount of boiled pork for one person
- Napa cabbage (they'll gladly give you more if you ask)
- Rice
- Warm cabbage soup

### Amazing Taste of Cabbage Soup

The cabbage soup was particularly impressive. The seasoning was so good that I wanted another bowl. This restaurant has excellent seasoning overall. Even the young radish kimchi was perfectly seasoned and enjoyable to eat.

## Buckwheat Pancake: Disappointing Choice

I got excited and ordered buckwheat pancake with beer, but this was somewhat disappointing.

Compared to the cold buckwheat noodles and bossam set meal, it wasn't as impressive. The texture felt like eating sundae (blood sausage). However, the buckwheat wrapper was chewy and good, which seems to prove that this restaurant's buckwheat batter is excellent.

## Price: Surprisingly Affordable

Final bill breakdown:

- Cold buckwheat noodles: 12,000 won
- Bossam set meal: 12,000 won
- Buckwheat pancake: 7,000 won
- Beer (Cass): 5,000 won
- **Total: 36,000 won**

I was really surprised that we could eat this much and even drink alcohol for under 40,000 won for two people. Considering today's prices, it's really affordable.

## Waiting and Tips

### Prepare for Long Waits

The wait is really long. When I went, there were 80 teams waiting, and when I left, 139 teams were waiting. We waited about an hour for 80 teams.

### Amazing Turnover Rate

The turnover is faster than expected. Once you get inside, you'll be amazed at how quickly the food comes out. You can receive your food about 5 minutes after ordering.

### Clothing Tip

The interior temperature can be a bit cold. Since it's hot outside, they blast the air conditioning, which can feel a bit chilly when eating cold buckwheat noodles. I recommend bringing a light jacket.

## Overall Review

Gwanghwamun Mijin lives up to its 70+ year tradition. I especially recommend the cold buckwheat noodles and bossam set meal. While the long wait time can be burdensome, the taste and price make it worthwhile.

However, I don't think you need to order the buckwheat pancake - the cold buckwheat noodles and bossam set meal alone will provide a satisfying meal.

This restaurant has been added to my list of places to keep visiting!
