## 🎯 What are GoF Design Patterns?

GoF stands for 'Gang of Four,' referring to the four authors of the book on design patterns that provides solutions to common problems in object-oriented programming. The patterns they compiled are a great help in increasing code reusability, maintainability, and scalability. ✨

Design patterns are broadly divided into three categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. In this article, we will focus on the **Creational Patterns**, which deal with object creation. 🏗️

## 1. 👑 Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern, as the name suggests, is a design pattern that **enforces the existence of only one object per class**. The key is that the instance is unique, as implied by the word `single`. 👑

### 🏗️ Basic Structure

In class-based languages, a singleton is typically implemented as follows:

```javascript
class Singleton {
  constructor() {
    // Check if an instance already exists.
    if (Singleton.instance) {
      return Singleton.instance;
    }

    this.message = "I am a class-based unique instance";
    // If not, store the current instance.
    Singleton.instance = this;
  }
}

// Usage Example
const a = new Singleton();
const b = new Singleton();

console.log(a === b); // true ✅
console.log(a.message); // "I am a class-based unique instance"
```

Although `new Singleton()` was called twice, the variables `a` and `b` refer to the exact same instance. 🎯

### 🤔 When is it needed?

It is useful when there is a resource that needs to be shared globally across the application. A typical example is a **Logger**. 📝

If there are multiple Logger instances, logs might be recorded in a distributed manner. ⚠️

```javascript
class Logger {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.logs = [];
  }

  log(message) {
    this.logs.push(`[${this.name}] ${message}`);
  }

  printLogs() {
    console.log(this.logs.join("\n"));
  }
}

// Case where two instances are created 😵
const loggerA = new Logger("A");
const loggerB = new Logger("B");

loggerA.log("Server started");
loggerB.log("DB connected");
loggerA.log("User logged in");

// Logs are stored separately in each instance. 😞
loggerA.printLogs();
// [A] Server started
// [A] User logged in

loggerB.printLogs();
// [B] DB connected
```

By applying the Singleton pattern to the Logger, even if instances are created in multiple places, only one instance is actually used, allowing for centralized log management. ✅

```javascript
class Logger {
  constructor() {
    if (Logger.instance) {
      return Logger.instance;
    }
    this.logs = [];
    Logger.instance = this;
  }

  log(message) {
    this.logs.push(message);
  }

  printLogs() {
    console.log(this.logs.join("\n"));
  }
}

// It's okay to call Logger from multiple places. 😊
const logger1 = new Logger();
const logger2 = new Logger();

logger1.log("Server started");
logger2.log("DB connected");
logger1.log("User logged in");

// All logs are recorded in a single instance. 🎉
logger1.printLogs();
/*
Server started
DB connected
User logged in
*/

console.log(logger1 === logger2); // true ✅
```

> - Enforces that a class has only one instance. 👑

## 2. 🏭 Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern is a pattern where **the interface for creating objects is defined in a superclass, but the decision of which class's instance to create is left to the subclasses**. ⚙️

This pattern involves two main structures: `Creator` and `Product`.

- **Product**: Defines the common interface for the objects to be created. 📋
- **Creator**: Defines the `factoryMethod()` that creates a `Product`. The actual creation logic is handled by the subclass `Creator`. 🏗️

### 🏗️ Basic Structure

Let's take a payment system as an example. There are various payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.), but the overall flow of 'payment processing' is the same. 💳

```javascript
// Product Interface (Payment Gateway)
class PaymentGateway {
  pay(amount) {
    throw new Error("pay() must be implemented.");
  }
}

// Concrete Product 1 (Card Payment)
class CardGateway extends PaymentGateway {
  pay(amount) {
    console.log(`💳 Paid ${amount} with credit card`);
  }
}

// Concrete Product 2 (PayPal Payment)
class PaypalGateway extends PaymentGateway {
  pay(amount) {
    console.log(`🅿️ Paid ${amount} with PayPal`);
  }
}

// Creator (Parent Payment Processor)
class PaymentProcessor {
  // This method does not depend on the specific payment method. 🎯
  process(amount) {
    const gateway = this.createGateway(); // Call Factory Method
    gateway.pay(amount);
  }

  // Factory Method (Subclasses implement the specifics)
  createGateway() {
    throw new Error("createGateway() must be overridden.");
  }
}

// Concrete Creator 1 (Card Payment Processor)
class CardPaymentProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
  createGateway() {
    return new CardGateway();
  }
}

// Concrete Creator 2 (PayPal Payment Processor)
class PaypalPaymentProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
  createGateway() {
    return new PaypalGateway();
  }
}

// Usage Example ✨
const cardProcessor = new CardPaymentProcessor();
cardProcessor.process(10000); // 💳 Paid 10000 with credit card

const paypalProcessor = new PaypalPaymentProcessor();
paypalProcessor.process(20000); // 🅿️ Paid 20000 with PayPal
```

### 🚀 Scalability

The biggest advantage of the Factory Method is **scalability**. If a new payment method, 'KakaoPay,' needs to be added, there is no need to modify the existing code at all. 🎉

```javascript
// New Concrete Product
class KakaoPayGateway extends PaymentGateway {
  pay(amount) {
    console.log(`💛 Paid ${amount} with KakaoPay`);
  }
}

// New Concrete Creator
class KakaoPayPaymentProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
  createGateway() {
    return new KakaoPayGateway();
  }
}

// New functionality can be used immediately 🚀
const kakaoProcessor = new KakaoPayPaymentProcessor();
kakaoProcessor.process(15000); // 💛 Paid 15000 with KakaoPay
```

What if we handled this with a simple `if/switch` statement instead of the Factory Method? 🤔

```javascript
function createGateway(type) {
  if (type === "card") return new CardGateway();
  if (type === "paypal") return new PaypalGateway();
  // When adding 'KakaoPay', modifying the code below is unavoidable. 😰
  if (type === "kakaopay") return new KakaoPayGateway(); // ❌ OCP violation
}
```

### ✅ Core Concept: OCP (Open-Closed Principle)

The Factory Method demonstrates one of the five principles of object-oriented design (SOLID), the OCP. 📐

- **Open for extension**: New payment methods (`KakaoPay`) can be easily added. ➕
- **Closed for modification**: There's no need to modify existing `PaymentProcessor` or other payment-related classes to add new functionality. 🔒

This way, using the Factory Method pattern allows you to create systems that are flexible to change and have good scalability. 💪

> 💡 **Factory Method Pattern Keywords**
>
> - Define an interface for creating objects in a superclass 🏗️
> - Create instances in subclasses ⚙️
> - Separate the interface from the classes that actually create objects 🔀

## 3. 🔨 Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern is a design pattern that **separates the construction of complex objects step by step**, allowing the same construction process to create different representation results. It's particularly useful when constructor parameters are numerous or when the object creation process is complex with multiple steps. 🏗️

### 😵 Have you ever seen code like this?

When there are too many parameters in a constructor when creating an object, it's sometimes called the 'Telescoping Constructor Pattern'.

```javascript
// 💩 Constructor with too many parameters
class HttpRequest {
  constructor(method, url, headers, body, timeout, retries, cache, useHttps) {
    this.method = method;
    this.url = url;
    this.headers = headers || {};
    this.body = body || null;
    this.timeout = timeout || 10000;
    this.retries = retries || 3;
    this.cache = cache || false;
    this.useHttps = useHttps || true;
  }
}

// Very inconvenient to use. 😫
const req = new HttpRequest(
  "GET",
  "https://api.example.com/data",
  { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  null,
  15000,
  5,
  true,
  true
);
```

The problems with the above code are: ⚠️

- **Poor readability**: It's hard to understand what each parameter does. 😵
- **Error-prone**: It's easy to input parameters in the wrong order. 🔀
- **Lack of flexibility**: Even if you want to set only some parameters, you have to keep passing `null` or `undefined`. 😓

### ✨ Improving with Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern can solve this problem elegantly.

```javascript
// Product (Result)
class HttpRequest {
  constructor(builder) {
    this.method = builder.method;
    this.url = builder.url;
    this.headers = builder.headers;
    this.body = builder.body;
    this.timeout = builder.timeout;
    this.retries = builder.retries;
    this.cache = builder.cache;
    this.useHttps = builder.useHttps;
  }

  send() {
    console.log(`[${this.method}] ${this.url} request sent 🚀`);
    // ... actual request logic ...
  }
}

// Builder
class HttpRequestBuilder {
  constructor() {
    // Set default values ⚙️
    this.method = "GET";
    this.headers = {};
    this.timeout = 10000;
    this.retries = 3;
    this.cache = false;
    this.useHttps = true;
  }

  // Each setting method returns the builder instance itself (this). (Method chaining) 🔗
  setMethod(method) {
    this.method = method;
    return this; // Return self to enable method chaining
  }

  setUrl(url) {
    this.url = url;
    return this;
  }

  setHeaders(headers) {
    this.headers = headers;
    return this;
  }

  setBody(body) {
    this.body = body;
    return this;
  }

  setTimeout(timeout) {
    this.timeout = timeout;
    return this;
  }

  // ... other setting methods ...

  // Finally, the build() method creates the HttpRequest object. 🏗️
  build() {
    if (!this.url) {
      throw new Error("URL is required. ⚠️");
    }
    return new HttpRequest(this);
  }
}

// ✨ Usage is much clearer and more flexible.
const request = new HttpRequestBuilder()
  .setMethod("POST")
  .setUrl("https://api.example.com/users")
  .setHeaders({ "Content-Type": "application/json" })
  .setBody({ name: "John Doe" })
  .setTimeout(5000)
  .build();

request.send(); // [POST] https://api.example.com/users request sent 🚀
```

Through the above example, we learned about the Builder pattern that separates the method of creating objects (`HttpRequestBuilder` class) from the method of implementing objects (`HttpRequest` class) when creating complex objects (many properties, nested structures...). 🎯

> - Method of creating objects (process) ⚙️

>

## 4. 🧬 Prototype Pattern

The Prototype pattern is a design pattern that **creates new objects by cloning existing objects**. Instead of using the `new` keyword to create objects from classes, it copies a prototype object and modifies the necessary parts before use. It's particularly useful when object creation is expensive or when the process of creating objects from classes is complex. 💡

JavaScript is a prototype-based language, so this pattern can be utilized very naturally. 🚀

### 🏗️ Basic Structure

Let's look at an example of creating game characters. All characters share basic stats (health, mana), but each can have different names and jobs. ⚔️

```javascript
// Prototype (Original object)
const characterPrototype = {
  hp: 100,
  mp: 50,
  attack(target) {
    console.log(`${this.name} attacks ${target}! ⚔️`);
  },
  // Method to clone the object
  clone() {
    // Use Object.create() to create a new object based on the prototype. 🧬
    return Object.create(this);
  },
};

// Create new objects by cloning the prototype ✨
const warrior = characterPrototype.clone();
warrior.name = "Strong Warrior";
warrior.job = "Warrior";
warrior.hp = 150; // Change from default value

const mage = characterPrototype.clone();
mage.name = "Wise Mage";
mage.job = "Mage";
mage.mp = 120; // Change from default value

warrior.attack("Orc"); // Strong Warrior attacks Orc! ⚔️
mage.attack("Goblin"); // Wise Mage attacks Goblin! ⚔️

console.log(warrior.hp); // 150 💪
console.log(mage.hp); // 100 (uses the original prototype value) ✅
```

`Object.create()` creates a new object using the specified prototype object. Objects created this way inherit the properties and methods of the original while being able to have their own unique state. 🎯

### 🤔 When is it needed?

- **When object creation is expensive**: If you need to query heavy data from a database to create objects, you can gain performance benefits by cloning a once-created object instead of creating it every time. 💾
- **When you need to create various types of objects**: Without creating many subclasses like the Factory Method pattern, you can easily create various variant objects with just a few prototype objects. 🎨

In JavaScript, the Prototype pattern can be implemented simply through `Object.create()` or spread syntax (`{...original, ...overrides}`). ⚡

> 💡 **Prototype Pattern Keywords**
>
> - Clone original objects to create new objects. 🧬
>
> - Can create objects without the `new` keyword. ✨
>
> - Effective when object creation is expensive. 💰

## 5. 🏪 Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern **provides an interface for creating sets of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes. While the Factory Method pattern focuses on creating a single object, Abstract Factory is used to create 'families of products'. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

The most common example is managing UI component themes. According to light mode and dark mode, multiple UI elements like buttons, checkboxes, windows, etc., need to have consistent styles. 🎨

### 🏗️ Basic Structure

```javascript
// Abstract Product A: Button
class Button {
  paint() {
    throw new Error("paint() must be implemented.");
  }
}

// Concrete Product A1: LightButton
class LightButton extends Button {
  paint() {
    console.log("🎨 Drawing light theme button. ☀️");
  }
}

// Concrete Product A2: DarkButton
class DarkButton extends Button {
  paint() {
    console.log("🎨 Drawing dark theme button. 🌙");
  }
}

// Abstract Product B: Checkbox
class Checkbox {
  paint() {
    throw new Error("paint() must be implemented.");
  }
}

// Concrete Product B1: LightCheckbox
class LightCheckbox extends Checkbox {
  paint() {
    console.log("✅ Drawing light theme checkbox. ☀️");
  }
}

// Concrete Product B2: DarkCheckbox
class DarkCheckbox extends Checkbox {
  paint() {
    console.log("✅ Drawing dark theme checkbox. 🌙");
  }
}

// Abstract Factory
class GUIFactory {
  createButton() {
    throw new Error("createButton() must be implemented.");
  }
  createCheckbox() {
    throw new Error("createCheckbox() must be implemented.");
  }
}

// Concrete Factory 1: LightThemeFactory
class LightThemeFactory extends GUIFactory {
  createButton() {
    return new LightButton();
  }
  createCheckbox() {
    return new LightCheckbox();
  }
}

// Concrete Factory 2: DarkThemeFactory
class DarkThemeFactory extends GUIFactory {
  createButton() {
    return new DarkButton();
  }
  createCheckbox() {
    return new DarkCheckbox();
  }
}

// Client Code 🎯
function renderUI(factory) {
  const button = factory.createButton();
  const checkbox = factory.createCheckbox();
  button.paint();
  checkbox.paint();
}

// Render UI with light theme ☀️
console.log("--- Light Mode UI ---");
const lightFactory = new LightThemeFactory();
renderUI(lightFactory);
// 🎨 Drawing light theme button. ☀️
// ✅ Drawing light theme checkbox. ☀️

// Render UI with dark theme 🌙
console.log("\n--- Dark Mode UI ---");
const darkFactory = new DarkThemeFactory();
renderUI(darkFactory);
// 🎨 Drawing dark theme button. 🌙
// ✅ Drawing dark theme checkbox. 🌙
```

### 🆚 Factory Method vs. Abstract Factory

- **Factory Method**: One `Creator` class changes the way **one product** is created through inheritance. 🏭
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating **multiple product families**. Clients can change the entire product family at once just by replacing the factory, without needing to know specific product classes. 🏪

> 💡 **Abstract Factory Pattern Keywords**
>
> - Creates 'families' of related objects. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
> - Client code does not depend on specific classes. 🔒
> - Can easily replace entire product families. 🔄
> - Provides API to users, and specific implementation is done in Concrete Product classes. 🎯

### 🤔 Meaning of 'API Provision' and 'Specific Implementation'

Here, "providing API to users" means the 'users' are not actual people, but **client code that uses the factory**.

- **API Provision (Abstract Classes)**: Abstract classes like `GUIFactory`, `Button`, `Checkbox` serve as a kind of 'contract' or 'manual'. 📋 Client code (the `renderUI` function) only looks at this 'manual' and calls methods like `createButton()` or `paint()`. The client doesn't need to know the actual implementation of `LightButton` or `DarkButton` at all. 🔒
- **Specific Implementation (Concrete Classes)**: Concrete classes like `LightThemeFactory` or `DarkButton` are 'implementers' who actually fulfill the contents of the 'contract'. 👷‍♂️ When a `createButton()` request comes, they create **actual light/dark theme button objects**, and when a `paint()` request comes, they perform **actual theme-specific styling logic**.

In conclusion, client code **doesn't need to directly write specific class names (`LightButton`) in the code** and only depends on the abstract 'manual (API)'. Thanks to this, a flexible structure is created where just by replacing the factory, the entire product family (theme) can be changed at once. 🔄✨
