## Main Subjects for the Practical Exam Theory Questions

> ‚ùóÔ∏è When including SQL queries (DB subject) in theory questions.

| Subject        | # of Questions   |
| :------------- | :--------------- |
| DB             | 3-4 questions    |
| SW Development | 2 questions      |
| SW Design      | 1-2 questions    |
| Network/OS     | 2-3 questions    |
| Security       | 1-2 questions    |
| **Total**      | **11 questions** |

- The table above shows the number of questions per major subject from 2023 to the first exam of 2025.
- The DB construction subject, which includes SQL queries, is the most important, followed by the programming language utilization subject, which includes Network and OS.
- As the theory question format has stabilized over the past two years, it is expected that the theory questions for the second exam of 2025 will follow a similar structure.

## 2025 Exam 2 Practical Exam Theory Question Forecast

<Details summary="How to Predict Practical Exam Theory Questions">

- The number of theory questions steadily decreased from 2021 to 2023.
- This was intended to put more emphasis on coding problems.
- As the number of theory questions decreased, the important theory topics, as judged by the examiners, became apparent in 2023 and 2024.
- Based on this trend, we have predicted the theory questions for the second exam of 2025.

### Increased Importance of Theory Questions

> Due to the rising difficulty of coding questions, you now need to get **7 theory questions** correct to pass.
>
> (Based on the first exam of 2025, there were 5 easy/medium coding questions out of 9. **Assuming you get all 5 of these right**, you need to answer 7 theory questions correctly to pass.)

| Subject        | # of Qs | # to Get Correct |
| :------------- | :------ | :--------------- |
| DB             | 4       | 3                |
| SW Development | 2       | 1                |
| SW Design      | 2       | 2                |
| Network/OS     | 2       | 1                |
| Security       | 1       | 0                |
| **Total**      | **11**  |

- To cover security, you need to memorize a vast number of terms.
- Security is expected to take the most time in the theory part, despite its lower priority.
- The SW Design subject has a narrow scope, and new types of problems are unlikely to appear.
- Therefore, **a strategy of skipping security and mastering the SW Design subject is advantageous for reducing study time.**

## Study Strategy for Coding Problems

A solid foundation in C, Java, and Python is essential for solving coding problems. (A post on this is planned for a future update.)

If you understand these subjects well, you can solve any application problem.

## Recommended Books for the Practical Exam

The Soojebi series is a relatively good choice for preparing for the practical exam. Studying them alongside blog posts is effective.

### Soojebi Information Processing Engineer Practical Final Mock Exam

- For certification exams like this, solving many problems is always helpful.
- It contains a vast number of problems, allowing for repeated practice.
- However, for theory questions, it tries to cover too broad a range, resulting in many niche problems.
- This can lead to low mock exam scores and a loss of motivation.
- **Even if you get them wrong, don't try to memorize every obscure theory question; it's important to keep solving all of them.**
- It's recommended to start with the latest past papers instead of starting from the first one (try solving them in reverse chronological order).
- Starting from the first paper might lead to too many wrong answers, increasing the chance of giving up.

### Soojebi Information Processing Engineer Practical Basic Books 1-2

- Some parts of the theory are well-explained, while others are not.
- The well-explained parts are very easy to understand with diagrams.
- If you are strong at rote memorization, this book alone might be sufficient.
- It is recommended to solve past papers first and then look up the parts you got wrong in the book (this helps with interest and focus).

### Soojebi Cafe

- Very helpful for continuous updates with additional materials.
- Following the [Soojebi Cafe - 10-Week Study and Schedule Guide](https://cafe.naver.com/soojebi/232896) is recommended (helpful for studying the entire scope).
- Daily problems are also updated, and it's recommended to solve them.
