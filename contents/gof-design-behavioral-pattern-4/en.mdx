In the [third part on Behavioral Patterns](gof-design-behavioral-pattern-3), we explored the **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** and the **Memento Pattern**, learning how to process requests with multiple objects and how to safely save an object's state.

In this post, we will learn an elegant way to handle collection data and a sophisticated method for changing an object's behavior based on its state.

- **üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Iterator Pattern**: Provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying implementation.
- **üö¶ State Pattern**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object's class has changed.

Let's explore how these patterns can reduce code complexity and improve maintainability!

## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 7. Iterator Pattern

The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that **lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation** (like an array, list, or tree).

The easiest analogy is the **'channel buttons on a TV remote'**. We just press the 'next' button (‚ñ∂) to move to the next channel. We don't need to know how the list of broadcast frequencies is stored or what data structure is used to manage it. The Iterator pattern, in this way, hides the complex internals of a collection and allows access to data through a simple interface like 'next()' and 'isDone()'.

In fact, this pattern is already deeply integrated into modern programming languages. JavaScript's `for...of` loop, array methods like `map` and `filter`, and Java's `Iterator` interface are all implementations of the Iterator pattern.

### üèóÔ∏è Basic Structure

- **üìú Iterator**: The common interface for iterators. It usually defines a `next()` method to retrieve the next element and a `hasNext()` method (or includes a `done` property in the return value of `next()`) to check if the traversal is complete.
- **ConcreteIterator**: A concrete class that implements the `Iterator` interface. It implements the traversal logic for a specific collection and keeps track of the current position in the traversal.
- **üì¶ Aggregate**: The common interface for collections, which has a `createIterator()` method.
- **ConcreteAggregate**: A concrete collection class that implements the `Aggregate` interface. In its `createIterator()` method, it creates and returns an instance of a `ConcreteIterator` suitable for itself.

### üíª Example: Implementing the JavaScript Iterable Protocol

In JavaScript/TypeScript, you can implement the Iterator pattern directly to use the `for...of` syntax. An object with a special method `[Symbol.iterator]` is called 'iterable'.

Let's create a simple `WordCollection` class that iterates through words in alphabetical order.

```typescript
// Aggregate interface (for reference, explicit implementation is not needed in TS due to structural typing)
interface Iterable<T> {
  [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator<T>;
}

// Iterator interface (for reference)
interface Iterator<T> {
  next(): { value: T; done: boolean };
}

// ConcreteAggregate: The word collection
class WordCollection {
  private words: string[] = [];

  add(word: string): void {
    this.words.push(word);
  }

  // The method to create an iterator
  [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator<string> {
    let index = 0;
    const sortedWords = [...this.words].sort(); // Sort alphabetically

    // ConcreteIterator logic (implemented as an anonymous object)
    return {
      next: (): { value: string; done: boolean } => {
        if (index < sortedWords.length) {
          return {
            value: sortedWords[index++],
            done: false,
          };
        } else {
          return {
            value: undefined,
            done: true,
          };
        }
      },
    };
  }
}

// Client Code
const collection = new WordCollection();
collection.add("TypeScript");
collection.add("GoF");
collection.add("Design Patterns");
collection.add("Iterator");

console.log("Iterating through the word collection:");
// Since WordCollection follows the iterable protocol, for...of can be used
for (const word of collection) {
  console.log(word);
}
// Output:
// Design Patterns
// GoF
// Iterator
// TypeScript
```

The client doesn't need to know how the words are stored in the `words` array inside `WordCollection` or how the sorting happens. It can simply access each element of the collection one by one using a standard method like `for...of`. This is the **separation of 'access' and 'implementation'** that the Iterator pattern provides.

> - üîÑ Can provide **multiple ways of traversing** a single collection (e.g., forward and backward iterators).
> - üí° Many features of modern languages, like `for...of`, `map`, and `filter`, are based on this pattern.

## üö¶ 8. State Pattern

The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that **allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes**. Using this pattern, the object appears to change its class. It allows you to clean up code filled with `if/else` or `switch` statements for state management by separating them into distinct classes representing the state.

Think of a **'traffic light' üö¶**. A traffic light has states like 'Green', 'Yellow', and 'Red'. The behavior of the traffic light (changing to the next state) is completely different in each state. When it's green, it changes to yellow; when it's yellow, it changes to red; and when it's red, it changes to green. The State pattern **encapsulates the behaviors associated with particular states into separate classes** and simply switches the class responsible for the behavior when the state changes.

### üèóÔ∏è Basic Structure

- **üé≠ Context**: The main object that has a state. It holds a reference to a `State` object that represents its current state. When a client makes a request, it delegates the action to the current `State` object. It also provides a method like `setState()` to allow state objects to change the `Context`'s state.
- **üìú State**: The common interface for all concrete state classes. It defines methods for the actions that the `Context` will delegate (e.g., `handle()`).
- **ConcreteState**: A concrete class that implements the `State` interface. It implements the behavior for a specific state and, if necessary, decides and changes the next state of the `Context`.

### üíª Example: Online Document Publishing Workflow

Let's create an online document object that has 'Draft' -> 'Moderation' -> 'Published' states.

First, let's define the `DocumentState` interface that all states will follow.

```typescript
// State interface
interface DocumentState {
  publish(): void;
}
```

Next, let's create the `Context` object, the `Document` class, which will have a state.

```typescript
// Context: The document object that has a state
class Document {
  private state: DocumentState;

  constructor() {
    // The initial state is 'Draft'
    this.state = new DraftState(this);
  }

  // Method for changing the state
  changeState(state: DocumentState): void {
    this.state = state;
  }

  // Delegate the action to the current state
  publish(): void {
    this.state.publish();
  }
}
```

Now, let's create the `ConcreteState` classes that define the behavior for each state.

```typescript
// ConcreteState 1: Draft State
class DraftState implements DocumentState {
  constructor(private document: Document) {}

  publish(): void {
    console.log("Changing state from [Draft] -> [Moderation].");
    this.document.changeState(new ModerationState(this.document));
  }
}

// ConcreteState 2: Moderation State
class ModerationState implements DocumentState {
  constructor(private document: Document) {}

  publish(): void {
    console.log(
      "Changing state from [Moderation] -> [Published]. The article is now public!"
    );
    this.document.changeState(new PublishedState(this.document));
  }
}

// ConcreteState 3: Published State
class PublishedState implements DocumentState {
  constructor(private document: Document) {}

  publish(): void {
    console.log(
      "[Published] The article is already published. No action taken."
    );
    // No state change
  }
}
```

The client code only needs to call the `publish()` method of the `Document` object.

```typescript
// Client Code
const myDocument = new Document();

console.log("--- 1. Attempting to publish from Draft state ---");
myDocument.publish(); // Draft -> Moderation

console.log("\n--- 2. Attempting to publish from Moderation state ---");
myDocument.publish(); // Moderation -> Published

console.log("\n--- 3. Attempting to publish from Published state ---");
myDocument.publish(); // Nothing happens
```

There are no conditional statements like `if (state === 'draft') { ... } else if (state === 'moderation') { ... }` inside the `Document` class. All state-related logic is delegated to the respective `State` classes. If a new 'Rejected' state is needed, we can simply create a `RejectedState` class and add it, thus adhering to the 'Open-Closed Principle (OCP)'.
