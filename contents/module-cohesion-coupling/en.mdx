## üöÄ Cohesion and Coupling at a Glance

Two important metrics that determine software quality are **Cohesion** and **Coupling**.

-   **Cohesion**: Indicates how closely related the elements within a single module are. **Higher is better.**
-   **Coupling**: Represents the degree of interdependence between modules. **Lower is better.**

| Cohesion (Higher is better)      | Coupling (Worst to Best) |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **Functional**                   | **Content**                |
| **Sequential**                   | **Common**                 |
| **Communicational**              | **External**               |
| **Procedural**                   | **Control**                |
| **Temporal**                     | **Stamp**                  |
| **Logical**                      | **Data**                   |
| **Coincidental (Accidental)**    |                            |

## 1. üß© Module Cohesion

**Cohesion** is a measure of how closely the components of a module work together to perform a single function. High cohesion increases a module's independence, making it easier to reuse and maintain.

### Types of Cohesion (Worst to Best)

1.  **Coincidental Cohesion (Accidental)**
    -   The components within the module have no relationship. This is the lowest level of cohesion.
    -   **Example**: A `Utils` module that contains unrelated functions like `sendEmail`, `calculateSum`, and `printReport`.

2.  **Logical Cohesion**
    -   Functions of a similar nature or belonging to a specific category are grouped into one module.
    -   **Example**: A module that handles all types of `input`. Mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen inputs are all handled within one function using a case statement.

3.  **Temporal Cohesion**
    -   Functions that must be executed at the same time are grouped together.
    -   **Example**: An `initialize` module that groups initialization codes that must run at program start (variable initialization, environment setup, opening log files).

4.  **Procedural Cohesion**
    -   Functions within a module are grouped because they must be executed in a specific order.
    -   **Example**: A `process_user_data` module that calls `read_data()`, `validate_data()`, and `save_data()` in sequence.

5.  **Communicational Cohesion**
    -   Functions that use the same input data or produce the same output data are grouped together.
    -   **Example**: A `print_student_info` module takes a 'student ID' as input and performs `get_name()`, `get_grades()`, and `get_address()` functions to output the information.

6.  **Sequential Cohesion**
    -   The output of one function serves as the input for another function in a sequential relationship.
    -   **Example**: In a `file_processing` module, the output (file content) of the `read_file()` function is used as the input for the `compress_data()` function.

7.  **Functional Cohesion**
    -   All functions within the module are organized to perform a single, well-defined purpose. This is the most ideal cohesion.
    -   **Example**: A `calculate_circle_area` module only performs the single function of calculating the area of a circle given its radius.

## 2. üîó Module Coupling

**Coupling** is a measure of how much modules depend on each other. Lower coupling reduces the impact of changes in one module on others, improving the system's maintainability and scalability.

### Types of Coupling (Worst to Best)

1.  **Content Coupling**
    -   One module directly references or modifies the internal functions or data of another module. This is the highest level of coupling.
    -   **Example**: Module A branches into the middle of Module B's code or directly uses a local variable inside Module B.

2.  **Common Coupling**
    -   Multiple modules share a global variable or a common data area.
    -   **Example**: Several modules read and modify settings from a global `GlobalConfig` object.

3.  **External Coupling**
    -   Two modules share an externally defined data format, communication protocol, or specific hardware.
    -   **Example**: Two modules share a specific file format to read and write data.

4.  **Control Coupling**
    -   One module passes a control signal (Flag, Switch) to control the behavior of another module.
    -   **Example**: Module A calls Module B, passing a `sort_method` flag that determines whether Module B will operate in ascending or descending order.

5.  **Stamp Coupling**
    -   Two modules pass a data structure (object, record, etc.) between them, but only a portion of the data is used.
    -   **Example**: A `Student` object (containing ID, name, address, phone number) is passed to a `print_address` module, but the module only uses the `address` field.

6.  **Data Coupling**
    -   Two modules exchange only the minimum necessary data (simple parameters). This is the most ideal coupling.
    -   **Example**: An `add` module takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, as parameters and returns their sum.
