> üí° **JSON, XML, and YAML** are standard formats for exchanging data between systems or managing configurations. Questions about the features and differences of each technology are common in the Information Processing Engineer exam.

## üìÑ Key Data Representation Formats

A defined format is necessary to exchange data or describe settings between systems. **JSON**, **XML**, and **YAML** are the most widely used data representation formats.

### 1. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

**JSON** is a lightweight, human-readable, text-based data exchange format based on JavaScript object syntax.

- **Features**:
  - A data object consisting of `key-value` pairs.
  - Simple structure allows for fast parsing and low memory consumption.
  - Primarily used in web environments, especially with REST APIs.
- **Example**:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "courses": ["Data Structures", "Algorithms"]
}
```

### 2. XML (eXtensible Markup Language)

**XML** is a markup language that uses tags (`<>`) to represent the hierarchical structure of data. It is similar to HTML, but a key feature is that users can define their own tags.

- **Features**:
  - Clearly expresses the meaning and relationships of data in a tree structure.
  - Highly extensible, making it suitable for representing complex data.
  - Formerly used extensively in web services (SOAP) and configuration files for various systems.
- **Example**:

```xml
<person>
  <name>John Doe</name>
  <age>30</age>
  <isStudent>false</isStudent>
  <courses>
    <course>Data Structures</course>
    <course>Algorithms</course>
  </courses>
</person>
```

### 3. YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)

**YAML** is a data serialization format that emphasizes **human readability and writability**. It is widely used for writing complex configuration files.

- **Features**:
  - High readability due to the use of indentation to represent data hierarchy.
  - Supports comments (`#`), making it easy to add explanations.
  - It is a superset of JSON, so most YAML parsers can interpret JSON documents.
- **Example**:

```yaml
# Person information
person:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  isStudent: false
  courses:
    - Data Structures
    - Algorithms
```

### üìä Comparison of Data Representation Formats

| Category          | **JSON**                              | **XML**                               | **YAML**                                     |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Readability**   | High                                  | Moderate (complex due to tags)        | **Very High** (concise)                      |
| **Structure**     | `key-value` pairs, brackets `{}` `[]` | Tags `<>`                             | **Indentation**, hyphen `-`                  |
| **Comments**      | Not supported                         | Supported `<!-- -->`                  | **Supported** `#`                            |
| **Primary Use**   | API communication, web applications   | SOAP web services, document structure | **Configuration files** (Docker, Kubernetes) |
| **Schema**        | None (JSON Schema used separately)    | Built-in support with DTD, XSD        | No schema                                    |
| **Parsing Speed** | Fast                                  | Relatively slow                       | Slower than JSON                             |
